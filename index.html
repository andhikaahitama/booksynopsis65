<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Old Evangelicalism</h2><p>Sin, regeneration, justification by Christ's righteousness, the cross, and the love of God, assurance of salvation - these are the truths that once thrilled churches and changed nations. Yet, where evangelicalism continues to affirm these truths, without such results, it is often assumed that she must have needs that cannot be met without something new. <br><br>These addresses by Iain Murray challenge that mindset. While the Bible not history is the textbook in these pages, Murray draws on the best authors of the old evangelicalism to confirm what a glorious message the gospel is.</p><p>Murray, born in Lancashire, England, was educated in the Isle of Man and at the University of Durham and entered the Christian ministry in 1955. He served as assistant to Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones at Westminister Chapel (1956-59) and subsequently at Grove Chapel, London (1961-69) and St. Giles Presbyterian Church, Sydney (1984-84), Although remaining a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, he is founding trustee for Banner of Truth Trust.</p><h2>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Vol. 1: Monstrous Compendium</h2><p>This improved version of the original &#34;Monster Manual&#34; presents all the information available about a host of vile creatures in an easy-to-use binder format</p><p></p><h2>Prey for a Miracle (A Sister Agatha Mystery)</h2><p>Sister Agatha is an extern nun in the cloistered order at the Our Lady of Hope Monastery near a small New Mexican desert town. As such, Sister Agatha is the link between her cloistered sisters and the outside world. Usually this means running errands in the monastery's slowly dying car (dubbed the Anti-Chrystler) or their motorcycle, with Pax, the order's German Shepard, in the side car. But sometimes it means something a bit more -- like now when the diocese is upset by reports of a young girl whose parents claim is receiving visitations from the Virgin Mary and&nbsp;providing insight into future events. Wanting neither to ignore a real miracle, nor give credence to what might be&nbsp;merely an attempt to defraud the faithful, they ask Sister Agatha to investigate. But her inquires are soon complicated when the girl herself disappears, apparently having been kidnapped, and Sister Agatha will need more than faith to bring her home.</p><p>DIVINE INTERVENTION<br>Sister Agatha is an extern nun in the cloistered order at the Our Lady of Hope Monastery near a small New Mexican desert town.

Handy examines how dramatic changes are transforming business, education, and the nature of work. We can see it in astounding new developments in technology, in the shift in demand from manual to cerebral skills, and in the virtual disappearance of lifelong, full-time jobs. Handy maintains that discontinuous change requires discontinuous, upside-down thinking, and discusses the need for new kinds of organizations, new approaches to work, new types of schools, and new ideas about the nature of our society.</p><p>In this fascinating book, Charles Handy shows how dramatic changes are transforming business, education, and the nature of work.

A trophy wife with a past survives a narrow escape from a brazen attack. Mobsters and moguls with no shortage of reasons to kill trot out their alibis. And then, in the suffocating grip of a record heat wave, comes another shocking murder and a sharp turn in a tense journey into the dirty little secrets of the wealthy. Secrets that prove to be fatal. Secrets that lay hidden in the dark until one NYPD detective shines a light. Mystery sensation Richard Castle, blockbuster author of the wildly best-selling Derrick Storm novels, introduces his newest character, NYPD Homicide Detective Nikki Heat. Tough, sexy, professional, Nikki Heat carries a passion for justice as she leads one of New York City&#39;s top homicide squads. She&#39;s hit with an unexpected challenge when the commissioner assigns superstar magazine journalist Jameson Rook to ride along with her to research an article on New York&#39;s Finest. Pulitzer Prize-winning Rook is as much a handful as he is handsome. His wise-cracking and meddling aren&#39;t her only problems. As she works to unravel the secrets of the murdered real estate tycoon, she must also confront the spark between them.

Their ideographs take on additional significance when considering the racist campaigns directed against them by the American Legion, the local, state, and congressional politicians, the newspapers of the Yakima Valley, and the Hearst papers in Seattle and California.<br>The media in the 'nineties are focusing attention on strained Japanese/American trade relations and on ceremonies, exhibits, and religious services to mark the end of the War in the Pacific. Dr. Heuterman details the Japanese-American experience in the two decades leading to the internment, after the outbreak of World War II, of western-region Issei and Nisei, the immigrants and first-generation Japanese Americans who came to farm the marginal lands of the Yakima Valley in eastern Washington after World War I.<br>Professor Heuterman, distinguished member of the faculty of the Edward R. Murrow School of Communications at Washington State University, uses the newspaper accounts in the Washington newspapers of the period to demonstrate a growing, systematic, institutional racism directed against the Japanese-American communities of Wapato and the surrounding area. Alongside the accounts of protests against the presence of Japanese tenant farmers on land the American Legion misguidedly thought should go to veterans, there are stories of Japanese-American contributions to the social and economic life of the region, as well as their efforts to share their rich cultural heritage with their neighbors.<br>Many readers will be indignant when this book reminds them of the fragility of the social fabric in a region whenever a segment of the population is accorded second-class status; others will be moved to tears by the fortitude of these Japanese-American families, who strove to adhere to the best principles of American democracy in the face of prejudice, harassment, violence, and, finally, dispossession and internment.</p><p>Thomas H.

New York fell and the anguished retreat through New Jersey followed. Winter came with a vengeance, bringing what Thomas Paine called &#x201c;the times that try men&#x2019;s souls.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Winter Soldiers </i>is the story of a small band of men held together by George Washington in the face of disaster and hopelessness, desperately needing at least one victory to salvage both cause and country. It is a tale of unimaginable hardship and suffering that culminated in the battles of Trenton and Princeton.

In particular, there has been a concentrated effort to uncover parallels between Scripture and contemporary secular works, especially through the application of rhetorical criticism and the analysis of other epistolary literature. A significant but often overlooked aspect of these studies involves identifying the methods of communication adopted by writers in a predominantly oral culture. John Harvey offers here a comprehensive study of these methods as they appear in the Pauline Epistles. <p>The first two sections offer a useful introduction to the field as well as a historical survey of the growth of interest in rhetorical studies and the investigation of oral patterning. In particular, the author explores their application to Greco-Roman literature and the Old Testament. Harvey describes and illustrates eight rhetorical forms: chiasmus, inversion, alternation, inclusion, ring-composition, word-chain, refrain, and concentric symmetry. In a semiliterate culture, such methods were particularly well suited for communicating the author's message and encouraging its memorization and continuing influence. Their identification can now assist interpreters in identifying both the overall structure of a document as well as those particular aspects that the author intended to emphasize. </p><p>The third and central section of the work is devoted to the study of the Pauline Epistles. While other scholars have noted Pauls use of particular rhetorical methods in limited sections, Harvey's work is the first to consider a broader range of Paul's writings and to investigate the uniquely oral nature of the patterns. He considers seven letters on which there is little debate concerning Pauline authorship (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon) and identifies the oral aspects of each. In the process, he illumines elements of Paul's thought that can be traced to his Jewish heritage as well as ways in which Paul adopted Greco-Roman rhetoric to structure the content of his letters and to emphasize certain points. He also suggests practical exegetical conclusions that can be drawn from the application of such studies. </p><p>This volume is the first in the new Evangelical Theological Society Studies series, edited by David W. Baker.</p></p><p>John Harvey (Ph.D., Wycliffe College, Toronto School of Theology) is associate professor of New Testament at Columbia Biblical Seminary and Graduate School of Missions in Columbia, South Carolina.</p><h2>The Collector</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Nora Roberts is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of more than 200 novels. She is also the author of the bestselling In Death series written under the pen name J. D. Robb. There are more than 400 million copies of her books in print.*Starred Review* As a writer, Lila Emerson is fascinated by people. So when her latest house-sitting job provides the opportunity to observe the neighbors in the building across the street, Lila can&#x2019;t resist. It is all innocent fun until late one night when she happens to glance across the street and sees one of the couples she has been watching involved in a violent fight. Before Lila can reach the phone to call for help, the woman falls to her death. The police initially rule the case to be a murder/suicide, but when Lila later crosses paths at the police station with artist Ashton Archer, the brother of the alleged murderer, he tries to convince her that his brother would never kill anyone, much less commit suicide. Much to her surprise, Lila finds Ash makes a good case for his brother&#x2019;s innocence, and that case only becomes stronger once the two find themselves targeted by a ruthless killer determined to tie up any loose ends. Roberts is performing at the top of her literary game, and the novel&#x2019;s opening nod toward Rear Window should clue readers in to the fact they are in for an addictive blend of sleek suspense and sophisticated romance that would make Hitchcock proud.

In &#34;Wanted: A Thug,&#34; a teenager seeks advice on how to steal her best friend&#39;s bad-guy boyfriend. And then there&#39;s Erika, who only likes white boys. Sharon Flake takes readers through the minds of girls trying to define themselves while struggling to remain relevant to the boys in their lives. This is a complex, often humorous, always on-point exposition of black youth resolving to find self-worth . . . any way they know how.</p><p>Sharon G.

Belived by children and adults, critics and booksellers, librarians and teachers, she is the author of six books for yourng adults that have sold more than half a million copies. The mother of a college-age daughter, Flake writes full time from her home in Pitsburgh.*Starred Review* Gr. 6-12. Hilarious and anguished, these 10 short stories about growing up black today speak with rare truth about family, friends, school, and especially about finding a boyfriend. Erika is a "ghetto girl" who likes white boys; she can't help it, and the other black kids in school can't stand her, because they know. Class is a big issue for Erin, who steals clothes so he can take a suburban girl to the homecoming dance. The church girls are forbidden to date, and they get hurt when they go hunting for boys. But their well-meaning parents don't have it right, and the girls won't stop looking. As with Janet MacDonald's fiction, the talk here is wild, angry, and outrageous, but there's no overt sex or obscenity. Yes, there are messages, but the narrative is never preachy or uplifting; it's honest about the pain. When one girl's boyfriend hits her, she apologizes "just like my momma does when daddy slaps her." The best advice comes from a dad who abandoned his family, who now tells his teenage daughter how to avoid getting stuck with someone like him ("you is so much more than a pretty face and a tight pair of jeans, some boy's girlfriend or some man's wife"). Not everyone makes it. The stories work because Flake never denies the truths of poverty, prejudice, and failure. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They now live in an old car. Zettie's daily routine includes waking up to blaring sirens and flashing lights, washing in cold water in a park rest room, being bullied by boys at school, and feeling hungry and resentful. Spending time with a friend who is also homeless, and a reassuring encounter with a concerned policeman bring comfort at crucial moments, but the girl's life is not an easy one. Not since Maurice Sendak's We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy (HarperCollins, 1993) has a picture book dealing with homelessness maintained such emotional intensity. The illustrations call to mind images by Georges Rouault. Pedlar's figures are defined with thick black lines; exaggerated features and the expressionistic use of color accentuate the family's suffering. In the end, Mama's successful day helping at a Health Fair and the promise of a job lead to a bed and shower in a motel-and hope.

Her layover in Denver had already been far longer than planned because of a storm that was coming in from the West Coast, and now she was&#x2014;<em>-finally</em>&#x2014;waiting by a luggage carousel at the Cheyenne airport. And waiting... As her friend Karin always said, there were two kinds of luggage&#x2014;carry-on and lost. And hers appeared to be of the lost variety.<br><br>December 21 meant it was almost the festive season, but her spirits were definitely on the low side.<br><br>This airport mess was typical of the dismal way her luck had been running lately.<br><br><em>Let's see.</em> She'd had to arrange for her aunt Geneva to move into assisted living. Dealing with that, mostly by email and over the phone, hadn't been easy. Then there was the fact that a stranger was staying at Geneva's house, the house Charlotte had grown up in. Of course, she'd questioned her aunt about Mrs. Klozz, asking how she and the mysterious visitor had met, but Geneva's answers had been consistently vague, even evasive.<br><br>Worried, Charlotte had called Spencer Hogan, an old friend and Mustang Creek's chief of police, to request a background check. He'd chuckled and said that wouldn't be necessary; Mrs. Klozz was, as he'd put it, "all right."<br><br>Finally, Charlotte had decided to drop the subject. She'd meet the woman soon enough and form her own opinion.<br><br>Despite all this, she felt uneasy.<br><br>Then&#x2014;just when she'd thought things couldn't get any worse&#x2014;she'd been laid off. Merry, merry Christmas.<br><br>Oh, the company, an advertising firm, had given her a generous enough severance package. Her boss had explained that budget cuts were taking a toll on everyone.<br><br>Not on him, apparently. <em>His</em> job seemed to be safe, unlike her own. It had taken some effort to not say something to that effect, but in truth, she just wanted to go home.<br><br>As she watched everyone retrieving luggage while hers was, predictably, nowhere in sight, she realized how ironic it was&#x2014;as a teenager, she'd been convinced that all she wanted was to leave the small town of Mustang Creek, become successful, meet the right man and never look back. She'd done it. She'd left. She'd gotten a great job. She'd met the right man. But she sure had looked back.<br><br>There was one other hopeful passenger waiting, and they exchanged a shrug of commiseration. The carousel was still moving, so maybe...<br><br>Yep, she'd left the small town. Got the dream job&#x2014;and lost it.

Her suitcase actually bumped out&#x2014;no more than two seconds before she was going to head over to the airline counter to fill in the claim form&#x2014;and began the journey toward her. Yay! Clean underwear for Christmas.<br><br>Aunt Geneva would tell her to count her blessings, and as she heaved her bag off the carousel and wheeled it toward the rental car area, Charlotte actually smiled. Things were already looking up. Oh, she still had to make the drive home with a giant storm roaring in, coasting a clipper from the Arctic, but at least she had her clothing. She'd need to make arrangements to have everything else sold or shipped home but would deal with that headache later. Her ridiculously expensive apartment had been sublet and all the rest of it was in storage.<br><br>The snow was coming in sideways when she finally reached her rental car.

She wanted the fragrance of grass in the summer, the view of the Tetons, the old grape arbor in the backyard.<br><br>She wanted <em>home.</em><br><br>Geneva needed her, Charlotte mused as she tried to figure out how to turn on the windshield wipers. But <em>she</em> might need this change even more. Losing her job wasn't a financial catastrophe since her aunt had taught her a lot about saving her money. She hated that the vibrant woman she remembered was slowly fading. Still, Charlotte viewed her own changed circumstances as a positive in some ways. They'd be able to spend time together. Quality time. Not just the fly-in, fly-out visits of the past few years. She could take care of the house, maybe use some of her savings to fix it up. The place had needed a new roof for at least ten years. She'd offered to pay for it more than once, but Aunt Geneva, her only living relative, had declined.<br><br>Stubborn pride was a family trait, no question about that. She came by hers honestly.<br><br>She should've looked more closely at the forecast, she decided when whirls of snow, like errant ghosts, circled her car. Almost no one else was traveling, which was just as well, since she could barely see enough to stay in her own lane. Other than the dim lights of one car some distance behind her, she had the road to herself.<br><br>She was happy that she'd grabbed coffee and a sandwich in the Denver airport, although&#x2014;exhausted as she was&#x2014;she could've used another coffee right now. She slowed her speed even more as she squinted at the increasing whiteout conditions. There was one other immediate problem she hadn't considered. She didn't have keys to the house. Aunt Geneva had been a seamstress, working at home; she was a wizard with her machine and had probably made most of the wedding dresses in Bliss County for the past half century. So Charlotte had never really needed one.<br><br>To be honest, she wasn't even sure there <em>were</em> keys. The doors with their beautiful faceted glass panels were original, and to her knowledge the locks had never been replaced. Maybe Aunt Geneva had given keys to the friend who was watching her house and taking care of her beloved cat and dog, but it was already after ten, and she wasn't going to get to Mustang Creek anytime soon at this speed.<br><br>It seemed wrong to go pounding on the door at midnight when she didn't even know this Millicent Klozz. She certainly didn't want to wake the poor woman from a sound sleep.<br><br>"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" came on the radio, and Charlotte turned up the volume. She loved the song, which brought back memories of getting tucked into bed on Christmas Eve, Geneva reading her a story and forbidding her to go downstairs until daybreak.<br><br>She'd always heeded this admonition&#x2014;except for the year she was seven. She'd gone downstairs in the middle of the night&#x2014;not all the way down that creaky staircase because she'd known she'd get caught&#x2014;and seen the packages under the tree. When she'd heard Aunt Geneva get up&#x2014;for a drink of water, judging by the running tap&#x2014;Charlotte had taken a small liberty and peeked at the gifts. Most of them had <em>her</em> name on them.<br><br>Then she'd climbed into her aunt's bed and nestled there, eyes wide. When Geneva had rolled over, she'd given a small scream, obviously not expecting a small face right next to hers, dimly visible in the glow of the hallway night-light.<br><br>"Santa was here," Charlotte had informed her excitedly.<br><br>"I hope he brought me a new heart," Geneva had replied, after gasping and pressing her hand to her chest. "Lord, child, you startled me."<br><br>"He came to our house!"<br><br>Charlotte still remembered Geneva hugging her, remembered the warmth of her arms, the loving smile on her face. "Of course he did."<br><br>Negotiating a slick turn, Charlotte wondered what her aunt had sacrificed to make sure Santa came to their house every year. As a child she hadn't comprehended the effort that went into raising a toddler. Especially if you'd inherited that responsibility in your late fifties, because your much younger sister and her husband had died tragically in a train accident. Geneva had been single and inexperienced with tantrums and packing lunches, and later on, cheerleading practice and track meets, sleepovers with giggling girls.<br><br>Her aunt had done it all unf linchingly, and when it had come time for college, given her guidance, but let her choose. Now it was Charlotte's turn to give back.<br><br>Jaxon Locke had been chased all the way from Idaho by the storm and it was starting to catch up with him, mentally and physically.<br><br>He had no idea if he was being an idiot or not, going to Mustang Creek. After their breakup just over a year ago, he'd continued, though casually, to follow Charlotte Morgan on social media&#x2014;they'd "friended" each other. A few days before, he'd checked in on her page and discovered that she'd left the firm. Even if she hadn't mentioned her plans to return to Wyoming, he would have known where she was headed.<br><br>No part of him believed it was a coincidence that both he and Charlotte had ties to Mustang Creek. She'd been raised there, and he'd been hired by his friend Nate Cameron to work as a veterinarian in Nate's practice.<br><br>He'd met Charlotte&#x2014;Charlie, he called her&#x2014;through an online dating service. Sort of.<br><br>Except he'd cheated. Sort of. He'd sat next to the girlfriend of one of his college roommates at a cocktail party. The event had taken place in midtown Manhattan. He had been working in a nearby Connecticut town at the time, and he'd come into the city for his friend Remy's wedding. This woman had studied him over the rim of her cosmopolitan glass, then asked, "Single?"<br><br>No doubt she'd made that assumption because while he'd taken the time to pick out what he considered a nice shirt, he'd still worn jeans and boots. His best boots, expensive, but he'd probably looked like a cowboy. "Not married, not dating," he'd answered wryly. "The invitation said casual dress. I took it to heart."<br><br>Her lips had twitched. "You could use a haircut, too, but the look you've got going suits your style. Put you in an Armani suit, give you a five-o'clock shadow and you could be on the cover of a magazine. You're from where?"<br><br>"Originally, Idaho."<br><br>She'd gotten right to the point. "I know just the girl for you."<br><br>He'd doubted that, not only because she was dressed in three-inch heels, wore too much perfume and spent most of the time talking on her cell phone, but also because they were strangers. "You don't know anything about me."<br><br>"Sure I do. Remy's mentioned you before. You're an animal doctor, right? You and Remy and a bunch of other guys all met at Ohio State."<br><br>He'd nodded. "We shared a house. And, yes, I'm a veterinarian."<br><br>She'd leaned in a little closer. "I work with this girl who's beautiful, smart and hates the city as much as you obviously do but won't admit it. Loves animals and is from a small town. Here's the catch. She refuses blind dates from friends. I do know that she's recently joined an online dating service. Let me write down her name for you, plus the site info. It won't hurt to check out her profile." Her smile was audacious. "Don't tell her I had anything to do with it."<br><br>"Since I don't know your name, that would be impossible."<br><br>"We'll do official introductions if the two of you actually get together, okay?"<br><br>"Okay with me," he'd said, figuring nothing would come of this odd conversation anyway.<br><br>"She's a Wyoming girl, Mr. Cowboy. I have a feeling you'll ride off for bluer skies and fresher air soon&#x2014;and I think she will, too."<br><br>The deliberately mysterious woman's cell had rung again and while she'd answered it, she'd scribbled down <em>Charlotte Morgan</em> on a napkin, along with the name of a popular dating site.<br><br>Even though he'd basically just been playing along, passing the time, Jax had realized he was curious enough to take a look at Ms. Morgan's profile.<br><br>He'd never even considered online dating. Later, when he got home, he'd typed in the information and, eventually, been completely...well, the English would have called it <em>gobsmacked.</em><br><br>Charlotte Morgan was beautiful, all right.

Sometimes I think how weird it is that Grandmother Grace, Mommy, and I have each had at least one stepparent in our lives. Are some people meant to be brought up that way? I asked Mommy about that, and she said so many marriages end in divorces these days that it is not at all uncommon for a child to have stepparents.<br><br>"People marry and remarry the way teenagers used to go steady and break up to go steady with someone else years ago," she says. She's very bitter about it, although she would be the last one to admit to that. Psychologists, both she and Miguel remind me, are not supposed to be judgmental.<br><br>"We help our clients make those decisions on their own. We don't impose our values on them," she said.<br><br>However, I have heard her angrily remark many times that the marriage vows should be updated. "They should be rewritten to say, 'Do you take this woman to have and to hold -- for a while or until you get bored?' "<br><br>Sometimes she is so down on male-female relationships that I have to wonder if I will ever find anyone with whom I might be happy and spend the rest of my life. According to what he has told me and how he acts, my stepfather, Miguel, has no doubts about it. He seems to be very happy and very determined to spend the rest of his life with Mommy. I have never said anything to her about it, but I think he loves her more than she loves him. I know he makes her happy. He makes her laugh a lot, and I can see she enjoys her conversations with him, especially when they are discussing social and psychological topics. But sometimes, more often than ever, I think, she can be very distant. Her eyes take on a glazed look, and she stares at the sea or suddenly goes off to walk alone.<br><br>She steals away when Miguel or I least expect it, walking through the house on "pussy willow feet." I have watched her without her knowing, observed her on our beach, and have seen her moving slowly, as slowly as sand sifting through your fingers, idly watching time go by, her face sometimes taking on that dreamy far-off expression, her beautiful lips in a soft smile. It makes me think she hears voices no one else can hear, remembers a whisper, a touch, or even a kiss she has lost. Something wonderful slipped through her fingers years and years ago, perhaps, and now all she can do is resurrect the memory.<br><br>"All our memories are like bubbles, Hannah," she once told me. "They drift by and burst, and all you can do is wait for another chance to blow them through your thoughts so they can drift by again. Reach out to touch them, and they will pop and be gone. Sometimes I envy people who have suffered loss of memory and who are never tormented with their pasts. I even envy Linden, lost in some world of his own."<br><br>I hate it when she talks like that. It makes me think she would like to return to a time before I was born, as short as that happier period in her life might have been, and if she could, she would sell her soul to do so.<br><br>How can she be unhappy here? How could anyone? We live on an estate called Joya del Mar. We have an enormous main house with halls so long and rooms so large, you could bounce your echo along the walls. The property is vast, too. On it we have a beach house, our own private beach front, a magnificent pool, beautiful patios and walkways with enough flowers and bushes to fill a small public park. She doesn't have to do any household chores. We have a cook, Mrs. Haber, and a maid named Lila who has been with us nearly ten years. Twice a week a small army of grounds people manicure our property.<br><br>Professionally, Mommy is very successful. She has a psychotherapy practice with an office in West Palm Beach, not far from the magnet school I attend. Magnet schools provide a more specialized curriculum. Mine emphasizes the arts, and since I like to sing, Mother arranged for me to attend the A. W. Drefoos School of Arts in West Palm Beach. We get up and go together most of the time, or my stepfather takes me.<br><br>This was the year they were supposed to buy me my own car so I could drive myself places, but they have yet to do it. They have this idea that I should first find some sort of part-time job to at least pay for my own gas and insurance.<br><br>"When you accumulate enough to pay for at least one year's insurance, we'll get you the car," she has promised.<br><br>She also promised to help me by looking for a job that could fit into my schedule. I moaned and groaned, wondering aloud in front of them if my taking on a job wouldn't hurt my schoolwork. Miguel laughed.<br><br>"Oh, having a vehicle and driving all over the place won't cut in on your study time?"<br><br>I hate having parents who are so realistic. The parents of other girls my age accept at least a fantasy or two. However, it is very important to Mommy and Miguel that I develop a sense of value, the one sense they both insist is absent in Palm Beach.<br><br>"Here, people would think it justifiable to go to war over a jar of caviar," Mommy once quipped.<br><br>I do understand why she doesn't like the Palm Beach social world. My maternal grandmother Grace wasn't treated well here, and Mommy blames many of her own difficulties on that. At times Palm Beach doesn't seem real to me, either. It's too perfect. It glitters and feels like a movie set. When we cross the Flagler Bridge into West Palm Beach, Mother claims she is leaving the world of illusion and entering reality.<br><br>"Rich people here are richer than rich people most everywhere else," she told me. "Some of the wealthy people here are in fact wealthier than many small or third-world countries, Hannah. They keep reality outside their gold-plated walls. There are no cemeteries or hospitals in Palm Beach. Death and sickness have to stand outside the door. While the rest of us get stuck in traffic jams of all sorts in life, the wealthy residents of Palm Beach fly over them."<br><br>"What's wrong with that?" I asked her. "I'd like that."<br><br>"They haven't the tolerance for the slightest inconveniences anymore. Sometimes it's good to have a challenge, to be frustrated, to have to rise to an occasion, to find strength in yourself. You need some calluses on your soul, Hannah. You need to be stronger."<br><br>"But if you never run out of money and you can always buy away the frustrations, why would it matter?" I countered.<br><br>She looked at me very sternly.<br><br>"That's your father talking," she replied. Whenever she says that or says something like that, I feel as if she has just slapped me across the face.<br><br>"You'll see," she added. "Someday you'll see and you'll understand. I hope."<br><br>Should I hope the same thing? Why do we have to know about the ugly truths awaiting us? I wondered that aloud when I was with my stepfather once, and he said, "Because you appreciate the beauty more. I think what your mother is trying to get you to understand is that not only do these people she speaks of have a lower threshold of tolerance for the unpleasant things in life, but they have or develop a lower threshold of appreciation for the truly beautiful things as well. The Taj Mahal becomes, well, just another item on the list of places to visit and brag that you have seen, if you know what I mean."<br><br>I did, but for some reason, I didn't want to be so quick to say I did. Whenever Mommy or Miguel were critical of the Palm Beach social world, I understood they were being critical of my father and his family as well, and even though they weren't treating me like a member of that family, I couldn't help but think of them as part of me or me, part of them. I'm full of so many emotional contradictions, twisted and tangled like a telephone wire with all sorts of cross-communication. It's hard to explain to anyone who doesn't live a similar life so I keep it all bottled up inside me. I never tell anyone in my classes at school or any of my friends about these family conflicts and feelings.<br><br>Feelings, in fact, are often kept in little safes in our house. There is the sense that if we let too many of them out at the same time, we might explode. Everything is under control here. We're never too happy; we're never too sad. Whenever we approach either, there are techniques employed. After all, both Miguel and Mommy are experts in psychology.<br><br>Daddy is always urging me to be different from them, warning me that if I'm not, I'll be unhappy.<br><br>"Don't be like your mother," he says. "Don't analyze every pin drop. Forget about the <i>whys</i> and <i>wherefors</i> and enjoy. She's like a cook who can't go out to eat and take pleasure in something wonderful without first asking the waiter for a list of every ingredient and then questioning how it was prepared, always concluding with 'Oh, if he or she had done this or that, it would be even better.' Don't become like that, Hannah," he advises.<br><br>Maybe he's right.<br><br>But maybe, maybe I can't help it. After all, I am my mother's daughter, too, aren't I?<br><br>Or is my mother going to forget that I am her daughter? Is she hoping for that little loss of memory she often wishes she had?<br><br>I have another fear, a deep, dark suspicion that I remind her so much of my father that she can't tolerate it anymore and that was and is the real reason why she finally wanted another child, a child with Miguel.<br><br>Perhaps it is my imagination overworking or misinterpreting, but all throughout these last months of her pregnancy, I felt her growing more and more distant from me. She had less time to talk to me about my problems and concerns. Helping me find a suitable part-time job and getting me my own car seemed to have slipped out of both her and Miguel's minds. She had more concern for her practice, finding ways to continue to treat or have her clients treated while she was recuperating from giving birth than she had for me. She wanted to stop going to work the last month, and she was always very busy trying to make arrangements. I could see that even our morning ride together had changed. How many times did I say something or ask something and she didn't hear me because her ears were filled with her own worries and thoughts?<br><br>"What was that?" she would ask, or she would simply not respond and I would give up, close up like a clam, and stare out the window wishing I had woken with a cold and stayed home bundled up and forgotten.<br><br>However, my school, my teachers and some of the friends I had filled my life with more joy now. Staying home would have been punishing myself for no reason, or at least, no reason for which I could be blamed. In fact, some of my girlfriends actually felt sorry for me. They thought it would be weird if their mothers became pregnant like mine at this point in their family lives.<br><br>"I can tell you right now what's going to happen," Massy Hewlett declared with the authority of a Supreme Court judge. "You're going to end up being the family baby-sitter, and just when you should have more freedom to enjoy your social life."<br><br>"No," I told her. "They have already decided to hire a nanny. My mother had one when she was little. She didn't need one when I was born because she wasn't working yet, but she has to get back to her clients, so it's different now."<br><br>"It's not the same thing," Massy insisted. "You'll see. Older mothers are more neurotic. They have less tolerance, and they tend to exaggerate every little thing the baby does. A sneeze will become pneumonia."<br><br>"Don't you think Hannah's mother would be aware of all that?" Stacy Kreskin piped up. "She just happens to be a psychologist, Massy. It's not going to be the same for Hannah."<br><br>"We'll see," Massy said, refusing to be challenged or corrected. To Massy, being right was more important than being a good friend. It never even occurred to her that she was making me unhappy. I don't think she would have cared anyway.<br><br>Reluctant to be defeated, she simply shifted to another level of criticism.<br><br>"Even if she doesn't find herself baby-sitting or being asked to hang around the house, she'll feel like she doesn't exist anymore. There's a new king or queen. It happened to me!" she cried, shaking her head at the looks of either skepticism or disapproval. "My baby sister is nearly eight years younger, so I should know, shouldn't I? I'm just trying to give her a heads-up about it."<br><br>Our little clump grew silent and then broke away like blocks that had lost their glue and exploded, sailing off in a variety of directions. I was left alone to ponder the way my world would change, feeling as if I was floundering on the border between childhood needs and adult responsibilities. Should I be whining about the way our lives were changing or should I accept and adjust?<br><br>Maybe I shouldn't care. Maybe I should be happy. I'll be more on my own. I won't be on everyone's emotional radar screen. It's good to be ignored, isn't it? Or will I feel more unloved and unwanted than ever?<br><br>The conflict in me kept me so distracted, I felt like I was lost and drifting most of the time. Sometimes I felt I had stepped into the quagmire of emotions. I had to face it and find a way out. Now, with Mommy's water breaking and little Claude on the threshold of our home and family, there was no more putting it off for later. Whether I liked it or not, whether I was ready or not, the whole situation was in my face. It was all happening and it couldn't be ignored.<br><br>There was going to be another child in this house, a little prince.<br><br>The princess would have to step aside.<br><br>On those rare occasions when either Mommy or Miguel were unable to drive me to school, our head grounds keeper, Ricardo, drove me in his pickup truck. Unfortunately for me, these occasions were so rare, I couldn't use them as an excuse or reason for them to get me my own car before I had a suitable job or earned the year's worth of insurance.<br><br>"What good is my driver's license?" I whined more than ever lately. "I don't get much of an opportunity to use it. It's not safe for someone to drive as little as I do."<br><br>"Now, there's a good one," Miguel teased. "In order to make the highways safer, we should increase the number of teenagers with their own cars."<br><br>"I'm sure we'll make it all happen soon," Mommy promised. "As soon as I get free of these other issues, I'll help you find suitable employment, and Miguel will look into what car we should get for you. Soon," she repeated.<br><br><i>Soon:</i> That was an easy word to hate. Adults, especially parents, used it as a shield to ward off requests and complaints. It was full of promise, but vague enough to keep them from having to make a real commitment.<br><br>Even rarer were times when Mommy's car was there for me to use. Right up to the last week of her pregnancy, she wanted her car at the house. It made her nervous not to have it available for an emergency. Ricardo could drive her anywhere if Miguel wasn't home, or even I could.<br><br>The morning Mommy's water broke, Miguel asked me if I would rather go with them to the hospital and wait for my baby brother to be born, but I told him I couldn't. I had an important English exam to take. I didn't, but I didn't want to be at the hospital. From simply listening to conversations Mommy and Miguel had about different clients of Mommy's, I knew enough to describe myself as being in denial. I resented little Claude so much I refused to admit to his coming and being. I actually imagined Mommy returning from the hospital without him and Miguel explaining it had all been an incorrect diagnosis. It had turned out to be a digestive problem easily corrected....</p><h2>Social History of Art: Rococo, Classicism and Romanticism v. 3</h2><p>First published in 1951 Arnold Hausers commanding work presents an account of the development and meaning of art from its origins in the Stone Age through to the Film Age. Exploring the interaction between art and society, Hauser effectively details social and historical movements and sketches the frameworks in which visual art is produced.<br>This new edition provides an excellent introduction to the work of Arnold Hauser. In his general introduction to <em>The Social History of Art, </em>Jonathan Harris asseses the importance of the work for contemporary art history and visual culture. In addition, an introduction to each volume provides a synopsis of Hausers narrative and serves as a critical guide to the text, identifying major themes, trends and arguments.</p><p>Arnold Hauser was born in Hungary and studied literature and the history of art at the universities of Budapest, Vienna, Berlin and Paris. In 1921 he returned to Berlin to study economics and sociology under Ernst Troeltsch. From 1923 to 1938 he lived in Vienna where he began work on The Social History of Art. He lived in London from 1938 until 1977, when he returned to his native Hungary. He died in Budapest in 1978. Jonathan Harris is Senior Lecturer in Art History and Critical Theory at the University of Keele. He is the author of Federal Art and National Culture: The Politics of Identity in New Deal America (1995), co-author of Modernism in Dispute: Art Since The Forties (1993) and co-editor of Art in Modern Culture: An Anthology of Critical Texts (1992)."This is an exciting, an irritating, a scholarly and an absolutely indispensable book.

For more than 40 years, Sim has been at the forefront of integrating ecological principles into the built environment. He served as California's first energy-conscious State Architect, authored seven influential books, and won numerous honors and awards for his leadership and innovation in architecture &amp; planning. Sim's collaborative approach and meta-disciplinary accomplishments help show the way to an evolving planetary era that values both the integrity of ecological systems and the quality of life. He is Professor Emeritus in Architecture at the University of California where he taught from 1961 to 1995, and president of the Eco-Design Collaborative (www.ecodesign.org) based in Inverness, California.By "sustainable communities," the authors mean largely self-reliant cities and towns whose use of fossil fuels has been sharply cut and whose economies are in balance with what the region can supply through natural processes. The bioregional approach, which some will deride as utopian, links the essays in this often provocative volume, the outgrowth of a "Solar Cities Design" workshop. Contributors include architects, community planners, ecologists and biologists. Case studies that demonstrate how human-scale communities could be built range from the undeveloped Chino Hills near Los Angeles to Philadelphia's gentrified neighborhoods. One essay faults agribusiness for its massive waste of land, energy and human resources; another calls for smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. While it has the disconnected feel of a volume of symposium proceedings, this book offers innovative solutions to the renewal of communities.

The text works on the premise that family therapy is a more effective form of treatment than hospitalization.</p><p>Gianfranco Cecchin (August 22 1932 - February 2 2004) was an Italian psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and founder - along with Mara Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo and Giuliana Prata - of the movement of systemic family therapy known today as the &#34;Milan Approach.&#34;This book will make the brilliant work of Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her gifted team more widely known in this country. The internal consistency of their approach&#x2013;combining a systemic theory of family with a systemic theory of change&#x2013;results in a therapy that is elegant, powerful, and economic. Using their knowledge of families as natural, rule-governed systems, the team proposes a hypothesis to explain the function of a problem in the family. They then base an intervention&#x2013;paradoxical or otherwise&#x2013;upon this hypothesis. The intervention serves to validate (or disprove) the hypothesis and to suggest further moves. The moves themselves are astoundingly compact. Palazzoli and her team are masters of the art of co-opting the resistance. They use the forces deployed by the family against change to produce change. It is as if one were to use the rules of Alice's Looking-Glass Kingdom to break the looking-glass. After the solemnity which surrounds the practice of the therapeutic art in this country, it is refreshing to find a practice which relies upon drama, wit, surprise, and (of course!) paradox. This is a book which should not only be acted upon but read. (Hoffman, A.C.S.W., Lynn)<br><br>This volume is a treasure chest of new and interesting ideas. The most luminous jewel in the collection is a paradigm, a new epistemology that takes seriously the revolutionary perspectives on human behavior introduced by Gregory Bateson, Watzlawick, Jackson, Haley, and others...Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her Milanese colleagues have labored with courage and humility and have provided us with a book of stellar magnitude.

Although the camping experience has a special place in the popular imagination, few scholars have given serious thought to this peculiarly American phenomenon. Why were summer camps created? What concerns and ideals motivated their founders? Whom did they serve? How did they change over time? What factors influenced their design?To answer these and many other questions, Abigail A. Van Slyck trains an informed eye on the most visible and evocative aspect of camp life: its landscape and architecture. She argues that summer camps delivered much more than a simple encounter with the natural world. Instead, she suggests, camps provided a man-made version of wilderness, shaped by middle-class anxieties about gender roles, class tensions, race relations, and modernity and its impact on the lives of children. Following a fascinating history of summer camps and a wide-ranging overview of the factors that led to their creation, Van Slyck examines the intersections of the natural landscape with human-built forms and social activities. In particular, she addresses changing attitudes toward such subjects as children&#x2019;s health, sanitation, play, relationships between the sexes, Native American culture, and evolving ideas about childhood. Generously illustrated with period photographs, maps, plans, and promotional images of camps throughout North America, A Manufactured Wilderness is the first book to offer a thorough consideration of the summer camp environment.</p><p></p><h2>Remarkable Feasts: Adventures on the Food Trail from Baton Rouge to Old Peking</h2><p>Gathers holiday recipes and menus from Louisiana, Thailand, France, Kashmir, Pakistan, China, Spain, Rajasthan, Mexico, and Canada</p><p>Liz Forbes is the author and illustrator of &#39;&#39;A Table in Tuscany&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;A Table in Provence&#39;&#39; and she writes a cookery column for the &#39;&#39;Sunday Correspondent&#39;&#39;.</p><h2>The 2nd Deadly Sin</h2><p>Coming out of retirement to investigate the stabbing murder of critically acclaimed but hated artist Victor Maitland, former Chief of Detectives Edward X.

Widely considered to be the father of modern African literature, he is best known for his masterful African Trilogy, consisting of&nbsp;<i>Things Fall Apart, Arrow of God</i>, and&nbsp;<i>No Longer at Ease</i>. The trilogy tells the story of a single Nigerian community over three generations from first colonial contact to urban migration and the breakdown of traditional cultures. He is also the author of&nbsp;<i>Anthills of the Savannah</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Man of the People</i>,&nbsp;<i>Girls at War</i>&nbsp;<i>and Other Stories</i>,&nbsp;<i>Home and Exile</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hopes and Impediments</i>,&nbsp;<i>Collected Poems</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Education of a British-Protected Child</i>,&nbsp;<i>Chike and the River</i>, and&nbsp;<i>There Was a Country</i>. He was the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University and, for more than fifteen years, was the Charles P. Stevenson Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College. Achebe was the recipient of the Nigerian National Merit Award, Nigeria&#x2019;s highest award for intellectual achievement. In 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement.Achebe's powerful critique of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as a racist mirror of Eurocentric attitudes leads off this challenging collection of essays on art, literature and social issues. The famed Nigerian novelist ( Things Fall Apart ) views literature as a medium that can help Africa regain a belief in itself to replace a posture of self-abasement instilled by its traumatic historical encounter with the West. Tributes to novelists Amos Tutuola and Kofi Awoonor, as well as discerning appraisals of writers such as V. S. Naipaul and James Baldwin, reflect his belief in the power of fiction to give us a "handle on reality." Overall, these concise essays deliver a forceful commentary on Afro-American life and letters. Summing up Nigeria's recent sociopolitical history as "a snatching of defeat from the jaws of victory," Achebe calls active participation in the political process a prerequisite for his country's, and Africa's, regeneration. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mira in the Present Tense</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Mira comes from a chaotic, artistic, and outspoken family in which it&#x2019;s not always easy to be heard.

Condemned for a murder he did not commit, Henri Charriere, nicknamed Papillon, was sent to the penal colony of French Guiana. Forty-two days after his arrival he made his first break for freedom, travelling a thousand gruelling miles in an open boat. He was recaptured and put into solitary confinement but his spirit remained untamed: over thirteen years he made nine incredible escapes, including from the notorious penal colony on Devil&#39;s Island. This edition of Papillon, one of the greatest adventure stories ever told, includes an exclusive new essay by Howard Marks.</p><p><p>Henri Charri�re, called <em>Papillon,</em> for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 for a murder he did not commit. When he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, one thought obsessed him: escape. After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, <em>Papillon</em> was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped -- that was, until <em>Papillon.</em> His escape, described in breathless detail, was one of the most incredible tests of human cunning, will, and endurance.</p><p>In 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape, Charri�re had his astonishing autobiography, <em>Papillon,</em> published in France to instant acclaim -- a worldwide bestseller describing the gripping, shocking odyssey of the author's imprisonment and escape over a greuling decade.</p><p>Born in 1906, and imprisoned in 1931, Henri Charri�re finally escaped in 1945 to Venuzuela, where he married, settled in Caracas, and opened a restaurant.

This collection highlights the critical role that indigenous intellectuals played in this cultural ferment. Scholars of history, anthropology, literature, and art history reveal new facets of the colonial experience by emphasizing the wide range of indigenous individuals who used knowledge to subvert, undermine, critique, and sometimes enhance colonial power. Seeking to understand the political, social, and cultural impact of indigenous intellectuals, the contributors examine both ideological and practical forms of knowledge. Their understanding of "intellectual" encompasses the creators of written texts and visual representations, functionaries and bureaucrats who interacted with colonial agents and institutions, and organic intellectuals.<br><br>Contributors.

But the reality of punk stretches over three decades and numerous countries, with a history as rich and varied as it is shocking and daring. With this lavishly illustrated and authoritative A-Z guide, now in a new format, Brian Cogan leads readers through the fiery history of a furious, rebellious, contradictory, and boundary-redefining musical genre and cultural movement that remains as massively influential as it is wildly misunderstood. As <i>The Encyclopedia of Punk</i> clearly proves, punk music and culture has produced a rich trove of material, above and beyond the hundreds of bands, from books and films to incendiary political movements.</p><p>Brian Cogan is a writer and professor and has written extensively on music and popular culture as well as music criticism. He received his Ph.D. in Media Ecology in 2002 from New York University. He teaches at Molloy College and has been a member of the punk scene for over 20 years and written for a variety of zines as well as journals, newspapers and magazines, and has performed and recorded with his band In Crowd since 1987.Punk rock is dead. Or is it? Pop-culture and media scholar Cogan believes that, although punk&#x2019;s original founders are long gone, the punk ethic and punk music still live on in modified forms. Though these forms may be radically different than what the pioneers of punk had in mind, they still reflect what Cogan terms punk&#x2019;s &#x201c;loose overall precepts.&#x201d; He has assembled this encyclopedia to help general readers get an idea of what those precepts might be. Entries are arranged alphabetically, and the bulk of them represent individual punk bands. Each band is given a date of existence; a breakdown of their history, including key members and personnel changes; and&#x2014;at the very end of the entry&#x2014;recommended albums for required listening, followed by a complete discography.Seminal bands may receive longer than the average entry length, which runs about two or three paragraphs. The book is unique in that it also has entries for punk&#x2019;s subgenres, movements, personalities, terms, labels, pioneers, &#x201c;svengalis,&#x201d; and accessories. Nearly every inch is splashed with high-quality images, including iconic album covers, live-concert photos, publicity stills, magazine covers, ticket stubs, handmade flyers, and famous recording-session photos. There is a two-page world map dedicated to punk &#x201c;scenes,&#x201d; giving the locations of the scenes and listing the bands associated with them. The end of the book is stacked with &#x201c;extras,&#x201d; including a punk time line (starting in 1974), a list of the 100 essential punk albums, a list of the top 10 punk drummers, and great moments in punk television. Punk rock is not for everyone, and there is some extreme language and behavior highlighted in the book, but this will be appreciated by those who are curious about punk and its origins, and what punk&#x2019;s been up to lately. --Jerry Eberle</p><h2>Rayburn: A Biography</h2><p>Sam Rayburn guided the most important legislation of the 20th century through Congress�&#x20ac;&#x201d;from the New Deal to the New Frontier�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and served under eight presidents during his remarkable 49-year congressional career.Rayburn is the award-winning biography of the Texas Democrat whose tenure of 17 years as Speaker of the House of Representatives has never been equalled.</p><p>Sam Rayburn made available his congressional papers, personal correspondence and taped conversation with the late Hardeman to Bacon (Congress and You, who completed this biography. The book presents an intimate look at a man who had the longest law-making career in American history, having served in the House of Representatives for 49 years at the time of his death in 1961. As Speaker of the House, "Mr. Sam" epitomized honesty and integrity in public service. Referred to here as "arguably the most underrated public official in twentieth-century politics," he is revealed as a major architect of New Deal legislation, adviser to presidents from Wilson to Kennedy, and a man whose "outrageously optimistic dreams came true." Rayburn's legislative battles are described in detail, from his confrontation with public-utility holding companies in the '30s to his last major victory, a showdown with conservatives over control of the House Committee on Rules. Also covered are Truman's reliance on the Speaker's counsel and the father-son relationship between Rayburn and his protege, Lyndon Johnson. An inspiring portrait of a politician who may have been the last of his kind.

(<i>Texas Books In Review</i>)</p><h2>Beyond Left and Right: Helping Christians Make Sense of American Politics</h2><p>The 2008 U.S. presidential election is already heating up, fueled by debates about religion and politics, and dividing people of faith. Many Christians want to engage in politics but feel underequipped and overwhelmed. Wheaton College political scientist Amy E. Black believes Christians must become politically educated, not stereotyped and polarized. Beyond Left and Right offers a complete guide to the inner workings of American politics, equipping readers to think intelligently and to actively engage politics with their faith. Black is intentionally unbiased and avoids fleeting hot-button issues, ensuring the staying power of Beyond Left and Right, even after the election dust settles. Recommended for Christians and students interested in faith and politics.</p><p>Who speaks for God in politics? Many Christians want to be politically active but feel underequipped and overwhelmed. Instead of drawing party lines, political scientist and former congressional fellow Amy Black offers a guide to the inner workings of American politics that encourages readers to make informed, faith-based political decisions. Beyond Left and Right addresses major questions such as: � What does the Constitution really say about church and state? � Is the United States a Christian nation? � What's the difference between a theological conservative and a political conservative? � Can Christians honestly disagree politically? Intentionally nonpartisan, Beyond Left and Right is a much-needed resource for Christians who want to apply their faith to politics. "For Christian believers who want to understand contemporary American politics, and for those who wish to take part, there is no better place to begin than Beyond Left and Right."--Mark A. Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame "Puzzled by politics? This clear, easily understood introduction by an expert on politics is what you need."--Ronald J. Sider, president, Evangelicals for Social Action "The challenge Amy offers each of us is to exhibit humble behavior in an environment in which humility is a scarce commodity."--Pete Hoekstra, U.S. Representative (R-MI) "Beyond Left and Right will be an inspiration and a helpful guide to those seeking to relate their faith to the complexities and challenges of politics."--David Price, U.S. Representative (D-NC) "This call to temper political zealotry with love of God, neighbor, and enemy will be of use to churches and academies alike."--Jason Byassee, assistant editor, The Christian Century "This book would be ideal for use in small groups--especially leading up to November 2008."--John Wilson, editor, Books &amp; Culture Amy E.

Later, the justices&#39; resolve began to unravel. Why? What were the consequences for the rule of law and for the life at stake in the case? These are some of the fascinating questions answered in Murder at the Supreme Court. Veteran journalists Martin Clancy and Tim O&#39;Brien not only pull back the curtain of secrecy that surrounds Supreme Court deliberations but also reveal the crucial links between landmark capital-punishment cases and the lethal crimes at their root. The authors take readers to crime scenes, holding cells, jury rooms, autopsy suites, and execution chambers to provide true-life reporting on vicious criminals and the haphazard judicial system that punishes them. The cases reported are truly &#34;the cases that made the law.&#34; They have defined the parameters that judges must follow for a death sentence to stand up on appeal. Beyond the obvious questions regarding the dubious deterrent effect of capital punishment or whether retribution is sufficient justification for the death penalty (regardless of the heinous nature of the crimes committed), the cases and crimes examined in this book raise other confounding issues: Is lethal injection really more humane than other methods of execution? Should a mentally ill killer be forcibly medicated to make him &#34;well enough&#34; to be executed? How does the race of the perpetrator or the victim influence sentencing? Is heinous rape a capital crime? How young is too young to be executed?This in-depth yet highly accessible book provides compelling human stories that illuminate the thorny legal issues behind the most noteworthy capital cases.</p><p><b>Martin Clancy</b> and <b>Tim O&#x2019;Brien</b> are both veterans of ABC News, Clancy as a producer and writer, and O&#x2019;Brien as the network&#x2019;s longtime law correspondent. They have each reported on capital punishment for more than thirty years, interviewing witnesses, detectives, jurors, murderers, judges, and Supreme Court justices. Their journalism has earned each a Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association, the Dupont-Columbia Award for excellence, and several national Emmy Awards. Clancy, a recipient of many awards for his investigative work, is perhaps best known for his partnership with Barbara Walters in producing marquee interviews with eight presidents, heads of state, and controversial newsmakers. O&#x2019;Brien, a lawyer, has served as Distinguished Visiting Professor at four law schools and lectures frequently on the Supreme Court and legal issues."This book takes the smoke screen out of the capital-punishment debate and dishes out the realities: the challenges to judges and lawmakers posed by awful crimes, competing pressures on the scale of justice, and the role of victims in determining punishment.

The resulting book, &#34;Coming of Age in Samoa&#34; has since become a classic - and the best-selling anthropology book of all time. Within the nature-nurture controversy that still divides scientists, Mead&#39;s evidence has long been a crucial &#34;negative instance&#34;, an apparent proof of the sovereignty of culture over biology. In this book, the author presents startling but wholly convincing evidence that Mead&#39;s proof is false. On the basis of years of patient fieldwork and historical research, Freeman refutes Mead&#39;s characterization of Samoan society and adolescence point for point. Far from the relaxed transition to adulthood that Mead ascribed to permissive child-bearing and restrictive regulations against premarital sex.</p><p></p><h2>The Corpse of St. James&#39;s (Dorothy Martin Mysteries (Hardcover))</h2><p><p>""Fans of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L.

Dams, an American, is a devout Anglophile who has wished she could live in England ever since her first visit in 1963. Fortunately, her alter ego, Dorothy Martin, can do just that. Jeanne lives in South Bend, Indiana, with a varying population of cats.Dorothy Martin, the American-born schoolteacher and amateur sleuth who makes her home in England, returns in this new entry in a popular series. On a visit to Buckingham Palace, Dorothy and her husband, Alan, a retired chief constable, discover a dead body in a private section of St. James&#x2019;s Park. As it turns out, Dorothy and Alan&#x2019;s friend, a former chief inspector, knew the victim, and the friend asks Dorothy if she could, discreetly, try to find out what happened to the victim. Fans of British cozies will enjoy this one very much (although readers who prefer more action might find it a bit lethargic. Martin isn&#x2019;t quite as engaging a character as Hilda Johansson, heroine of Dams&#x2019; other series, and the contemporary setting isn&#x2019;t quite as compelling as Hilda&#x2019;s early-1900s environment, but Martin&#x2019;s fans&#x2014;of all her work&#x2014;should be pleased. --David Pitt</p><h2>The house at Otowi Bridge: The story of Edith Warner and Los Alamos</h2><p>Hardback book with dust jacket titled THE HOUSE ON OTOWI BRIDGE: The Story of Edith Warner and Los Alamos.</p><p>The haunting experiences of a shy Pennsylvania woman who opened a tearoom in her adobe home that became a haven for neighboring nuclear scientists and Indians alike.</p><h2>Quick as a Cricket</h2><p>A young boy describes himself as &#34;loud as a lion,&#34; &#34;quiet as a clam,&#34; &#34;tough as a rhino,&#34; and &#34;gentle as a lamb.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m as quick as a cricket, I&#39;m as slow as a snail.

We can help them to see that the bizarre series of events that often characterize their dreams is actually quite typical of dreaming. The common elements of dreaming, flying, falling, being trapped, drowning, incongruous circumstances and waking suddenly in the middle of a crisis, are all part of Mrs. Honey's dream. <p>Mrs. Honey's cat, Thomas, knows what happened to the dream pirates - they got rid of them by waking up. Children should always be reassured of that, as real and often overwhelming and frightening as dreams may seem, they exist only in our minds and are gone when we wake. At the same time, exploring links between our dreams and our feelings can be fun and can help us to understand ourselves better. </p><p>Suggest that children make up their own dream-like story and enter it in the "Dream a story Competition" described at the end of the book. </p><p>Children will like the colourful vocabulary.

Through the skillfully disarming use of clich�d language and homilies, the play explores with subtle grace and depth the way the death of a child tears one family apart, while showcasing the talents of a promising young playwright who "in [a] very modern way [is] making a rather old-fashioned case for the power of the written word" (Jason Zinoman, <i>The New York Times</i>). </p><p>Fresh from its critically acclaimed off-off-Broadway run this past spring, <i>God's Ear </i>moves off-Broadway to the Vineyard Theatre in April 2008.</p></p><p><p><b>Jenny Schwartz</b>'s play <i>God's Ear</i> was produced off-off Broadway in May 2007 and moved off-Broadway in April 2008. Two of Jenny's plays, <i>Intervals</i> and <i>Cause for Alarm</i>, were part of the New York Fringe Festival, in 1998 and 2002, respectively. She is the recipient of a grant from the Lincoln Center Lecomte du Nuoy Foundation and is the 2007-2008 recipient of the Dorothy Stresling Foundation Fellowship at Soho Rep. Jenny completed two years of fellowship in the Playwriting Program at the Julliard School and holds an MFA in theater directing from Columbia University.</p>God's Ear <br> The Shadow of a Future Self by Nina Steiger &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Jenny Schwartz uses language like a composer might, embellishing a simple melody with harmonics. Harmonic pitches, made up of partial or component frequencies, are what give different instruments their distinct timbres and give us the ability to determine that two instruments playing in unison are in fact distinct from each other. The range of sounds an instrument is capable of is amplified and what we can hear is extended by these "partials." As a composer might use these tones to complexify a melody, likewise, Jenny's characters, scenes, and moments--fragments and partials themselves--are able to convey an expansive and nuanced emotional landscape using deceptively simple elements. When I first talked to Jenny about her process, she indicated that it could be a time-consuming one, working toward "getting it right." But it wasn't until we worked together on a script-in-progress for Soho Theatre that I truly appreciated the precision with which she forges the kind of moments that distinguish her work. She massages the rhythms and beats of each scene with an alertness to the intentions underneath each line. She has astonishing instincts for capturing the hidden languages we speak when we talk casually to the people we treasure most and intimately with those we don't know at all. Jenny's scenes are characterized by people in apparent isolation. They seem to find it easy to talk, but hard to say what they mean; simple to express something, but never in their own words. This creates a particular and often peculiar rhythm and vernacular. Her characters seem to invite us into the recesses of their marriages, their memories, and their dramas with the most familiar of phrases. Yet these phrases are applied in new ways, overturned and contraverted to let us know that there is more to what's said than what we hear. "I have deficiencies," Mel tells Ted. Repetitions are woven into the dialogue. At the heart of this is the accrued meaning a phrase or confrontation gains in repeated approaches, each time affording the characters a higher sense of emotional acuity and the audience a deeper sense of identification. Like an antenna capturing multiple frequencies, Jenny pinpoints lives comprised of fragments--echoes of memory and dreams, conversations we're too busy to finish, snippets we hear from other peoples' cell-phone calls, moments we observe in waiting rooms, lounges, and lobbies. The comparison to harmonics lies in Jenny's masterful use of partial thoughts and moments that combine to give her work its distinct flavor. Her writing captures something of the pain and humor within a particular dissociation so many of us feel today. These characters have borrowed words from the surrounding atmosphere and have anguish they cannot express. One of the most stirring moments must surely be a long speech of Mel's which becomes an aria of clich�s. It begins as a call to arms, a manifesto of newly made meanings and, by extension, possibilities. This speech ends with a reiteration of the marriage vows that are straining in the wake of a loss. We end with a maudlin couplet: "And the fat lady will sing. / With bells on." The play presents a mosaic; each of its tiles offer grace notes of misunderstanding, odd applications of everyday idioms, overturned clich�s, and phantom lines from one character in the mouth of another. What emerges from the fragments is a compelling portrait of grief and recalibration. It's a perfect snapshot of a family in transition and it articulates aspects of the human heart and the modern condition.

A hustler, carny, addict, petty thief, street philosopher, and chronicler of the demimonde, he was the archetype on which a generation modeled itself. In the 1940s, Huncke befriended the young William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, guiding them through New York's underground and introducing them to a world of volatile experience they had never imagined. His extraordinary ability to relate his life story in pared-down, unaffected prose inspired them to create a new type of literature, free of constraint and self-consciousness.<p>Huncke's work is a vital part of Beat literature, but until now has remained relatively unknown. <em>The Herbert Huncke Reader</em> includes the full texts of Huncke's long out-of-print classics; <em>Huncke's Journal</em> and <em>The Evening Sun Turned Crimson;</em> excerpts from his autobiography, <em>Guilty of Everything;</em> and a wide selection from his unpublished letters and diaries.</p><p></p></p><p>Herbert Huncke was the original Beat.

Huncke lacked in formal education but was nonetheless charming and articulate, a gifted storyteller. Encouraged by Ginsberg and others, he published several books, including Huncke's Journal (1965) and The Evening Sun Turned Crimson (1980).

Coverage includes Western architecture as well as that of Pre-Columbian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Southeast Asian. <p></p> The author includes a worldwide survey of important monuments, residences, government buildings, and religious structures, complete with photos, plans, and scales, including: <br> <br>* The Parthenon <br>* Cheops Pyramid <br>* Pantheon <br>* Hadrian's Wall <br>* Versailles <br>* Monticello <br>* The Brooklyn Bridge <br>* Boston Public Library <br>* Rockefeller Center <br>* Fallingwater <br>* The High Museum</p><p><b>A WORLD HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE</b> <p></p> In about 40 BCE the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius declared <i>firmitas, utilitas,</i> and <i>venustas</i> -- firmness, commodity, and delight -- to be the three essential attributes of architecture. These qualities are brilliantly explored in this book, which uniquely comprises both a detailed survey of Western architecture, including Pre-Columbian America, and an introduction to architecture from the Middle East, India, Russia, China, and Japan. Written in a clear and engaging style, the text encourages readers to examine closely in photographs and line drawings the pragmatic, innovative, and aesthetic attributes of buildings, and to imagine how these would have been praised or criticized by contemporary observers. Architecture is discussed in various contexts -- artistic, economic, environmental, political, social, and technological -- so as to determine the extent to which buildings met the needs of clients, society at large, and future generations. <p></p> This book also examines the unique methods of great architects past and present. Among them are Alvar Aalto, Robert Adam, Leon Battista Alberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Gustave Eiffel, Peter Eisenman, Antonio Gaudi, Frank Gehry, Walter Gropius, Imhotep, Le Corbusier, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Michelangelo, Glenn Murcutt, Andrea Palladio, Eero Saarinen, Koca Sinan, Louis Sullivan, Christopher Wren, and Frank Lloyd Wright. <p></p> The global reach of the text is matched by a rich assortment of photographs from the world over and a greater array of detailed line drawings than can be found in any architectural survey. The authors have created a formidable body of work that ranges over much of the world's architectural heritage and testifies to some of the greatest achievements of the human spirit.<b>Marian Moffett</b> (Knoxville, Tennessee) earned a B.Arch. at North Carolina State University (1971) and the M.Arch. and PhD. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1973 and 1975, respectively).

The authors richly textured narrative immerses us, battle by battle, in stories of the more than 175,000 black soldiers whose contributions have long been ignored or forgotten. More than a military history, Like Men of War is the stirring saga of people whose answer to slavery was a fierce determination to claim their full rights as citizens by force of arms.</p><p>Although countless books have been written about the Civil War, the role of black troops has been consistently underrepresented until recently. Nearly 180,000 of them fought--mostly for the North, but a handful even took up arms for the slaveholding South. Many wanted to serve at the start of the conflict, but a variety of factors kept them on the sidelines. Until Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, many Union leaders--including the president--held that the war was not about slavery. Racist views caused some to question further the value of black soldiers; there was also genuine concern about how Confederates would treat captured blacks.<p> But, as Noah Andre Trudeau reveals, black soldiers demonstrated bravery and professionalism from the moment they suited up. He recounts well-known events, such as the 54th Massachusetts' attack on Fort Wagner, as well as less familiar ones, such as blacks' involvement in the war's last directed combat one month after Lee's surrender. There were atrocities, too: in 1864, Confederates slaughtered black prisoners of war at Fort Pillow (Southern historians once disputed this brutal act of cold-blooded murder, but most scholars accept it as true today). Although Trudeau sometimes sacrifices his narrative drive to excessive detail, <i>Like Men of War</i> remains a compelling book full of strong battle scenes. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>By National Public Radio producer Trudeau (Out of the Storm, 1994, etc.), another solid contribution to Civil War literature, this time about the experience of the so-called Colored Troops, who fought on the Union side. In recent years, films and books, particularly Joseph T. Glatthaar's Forged in Battle, have focused scholarly attention on the once-neglected exploits of the more than 175,000 black troops who fought in the Civil War. In an account more thorough and expansive than Glatthaar's, Trudeau shows little-known varieties of black military experience: Amazingly, free blacks in the South offered their military services to the Confederacy at the war's outset, before the North made abolition one of its wartime goals, and blacks in the multiracial areas of Louisiana and the Trans- Mississippi had well-developed military traditions dating back to the War of 1812. The Confederacy never made use of blacks as soldiers, however. Well before the final Emancipation Proclamation, units of back US troops were being sent into combat. Trudeau describes how, unreasonably, Northern editors and military men repeatedly asked whether the former slaves could fight as well as white men, even after units of the ``US Colored Troops'' had proved that they could. Trudeau compellingly captures many of their actions in detail, including moments of glory, like the capture of Fort Fisher by black troops on Jan. 15, 1865; moments of tragedy and bravery, like the failed July 18, 1863, assault on Fort Wagner; and moments of savagery, like the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow by Confederates under Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest on April 12, 1864. Trudeau also traces the curious historical fate of the African-American soldiers after their mustering out: In the revisionist historiography and racist culture of early 20th centry America, they were forgotten, and even in African-American culture and literature, their achievements were neglected. Another fine work by Trudeau, and a good companion to Glatthaar's study. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Through prayer we turn our hearts and minds from our limited perspectives and concerns and begin to discern the divine will for the world. James Mulholland believes the self-correcting nature of prayer is being distorted by a culture of prosperity, which has refashioned prayer in its own image, making books such as <em>The Prayer of Jabez</em> huge bestsellers.</p><p>Prayer today bears little resemblance to the kind Jesus taught. For many, it has become a means of personal success and material gain, taking the form of a shopping list rather than a transforming spiritual discipline. Mulholland warns that we have forgotten the true purpose of prayer: He believes, "The point of prayer is not to tell God what you want, but to hear what you need. It is not approaching God with our demands, but listening for God's commands. It is not seeking our will, but learning to discern God's will. This is so important to understand in a culture that caters to our every whim. Prayer isn't about me. <em>It is about God.<em>"</em></em></p><p><em><em>Jesus understood the nature of prayer and taught his disciples to pray the beloved Lord's Prayer. Offering a fresh and compelling reading of this "Prayer of Jesus," Mulholland calls us back to the true essence of prayer. He shows how authentic prayer will lead us away from the self-interest of the prevailing culture of greed and move us toward the compassion, sacrifice, and love that are the hallmarks of the kingdom of God.</em></em></p><p><em><em><em>Praying Like Jesus<em> is an invitation to rediscover the life we are called to as Christians'a vow to transform our culture and world. The early Christians prayed like Jesus and were legendary for their acts of compassion and service. Mulholland believes this can and should be the commitment of Christians today.</em></em></em></em></p><p></p><em><em><em>Our Father, who art in heaven,<br>Hallowed be thy name. <br>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done<br>On earth as it is in heaven. <br>Give us this day our daily bread. <br>Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. <br>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. <br>For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. <br></em></em></em></p><p>In a time when spiritual seekers seem to be looking for a magic formula for prosperity, blessing, and protection through prayer, theologian James Mulholland offers a different perspective in <i>Praying Like Jesus: The Lord's Prayer in a Culture of Prosperity</i>. "Our Father who art in heaven..." Using Jesus's classic prayer from the New Testament as a framework, Mulholland offers a critique of the multimillion-selling book, <i>The Prayer of Jabez</i> and suggests looking to Jesus, rather than Jabez, for instruction on how to pray. In a conversational, almost pastoral tone peppered with personal anecdotes, Mulholland outlines a simple way to talk to God, focusing on self-denial, commitment, compassion, and gratitude. The point of prayer is not to get what you want, he writes, but rather to receive what you need. There's no pat formula for prayer here--just a call to revolutionize your prayer life through renouncing selfishness and committing to a new way of living. Those who find "name it and claim it" books about prayer alarming will be challenged by this satisfying, alternative take on the subject. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i><p>James Mulholland, author of <em>Praying Like Jesus</em>, is a theologian with ecumenical experience in the American Baptist, United Methodist, and Quaker denominations.

From his knowledge of MacDonald's writings, Michael Phillips has chosen approximately 90 readings for devotional meditation that are loosely centered around the themes of summertime and growth. Scripture selections highlight each passage and, as appropriate, brief excerpts from MacDonald's sermons and poems are included.</p><p>GEORGE MACDONALD (1824-1905), forerunner of the Inklings--Scottish minister, poet, novelist, and imaginative seer--was one of the most beloved Victorian authors throughout Great Britain and the U.S. in the 19th century. He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center Seven. After his death, most of MacDonald&#39;s books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald&#39;s reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century. MacDonald&#39;s most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald&#39;s prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: &#34;I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.&#34; Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage. MacDonald&#39;s writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald&#39;s novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis&#39;s later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia. In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis&#39; s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis&#39;s words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis&#39; s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman&#39;s influence in his own life, MacDonald&#39;s name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable. A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald&#39;s sermon extracts. MacDonald&#39;s name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips&#39;s work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald&#39;s stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald&#39;s books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime. Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.</p><h2>The Visitant: Book I of the Anasazi Mysteries</h2><p>At the Dawn of the Age of the Katsinas...<br><br>A woman runs away in search of a Spirit Helper and never returns...<br><br>An ancient village is swept into a shattering crime beyond reason, beyond belief...<br><br>An old man must learn to walk the dark labyrinth of a murderer's mind to find him before he can strike again...<br><br>A young war chief must enter the mesmerizing word of the insane if he is&nbsp;to save everything and everyone he loves...<br><br>And, a scant moment ahead in geologic time, world-renowned Canadian physical anthropologist Dr. Maureen Cole finds herself excavating a mass grave in New Mexico filled with the brutalized bodies of women and children.<br><br>From the internationally bestselling authors of <i>People of the Nightland </i>comes a novel of terrifying power about madness and murder eight hundred years ago.<br></p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesKathleen O'Neal Gear is a former state historian and archaeologist for Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska for the U.S. Department of the Interior.

Plus, there is a section on making crowns from flowers, decorating eggs, and preparing a tasty strawberry kysil. Unfortunately, some aspects of this title may be misleading. Although all holidays celebrated in Ukraine are listed at the beginning of the book, there is an emphasis on festivities associated with the religious festivals of Christmas and Easter, and readers may deduce that all Ukrainians are Orthodox Christians. Also, the majority of the photographs show people in costumes, and this gives the book an unwarranted ethnographic emphasis. From a visual point of view, the beautiful costumes with intricate embroidery are a plus. However, a caption for a picture of women in ethnic costume that states "Ukrainians dress in their festive best for the holiday" may lead children to assume that everyone dresses this way for special occasions. Oddly enough, a photograph of a boy playing a bandura does not identify this traditional instrument. Occasional insets in a scroll suggest topics to explore, but they seem a bit didactic as does the statement, "This is an excellent opportunity to get close to nature" in the description of a summer festival.

It appeared between plain covers on recycled stock, with a small photo (of lavender fields) pasted into each copy. The only publicity was word of mouth.<br><br>Part of Jan Zwicky's reason for having the author be the maker and distributor of the book was a desire to connect the acts of publication and publicity with the initial act of composition, to have a book whose public gestures were in keeping with the intimacy of the art. She also believed the potential audience was small enough that she could easily sew enough copies to fill requests as they came in. While succeeding in recalling poetry's public life to its roots, she was wrong about the size of that audience and her ability to keep up with demand as word spread, Hence, this facsimile edition.

Paul&#39;s antidote to a privatized and intellectualized faith will provide relief to many Christians today. To Philemon, a powerful church leader, Paul wrote a strong personal letter asking him to embark on a new relationship with his slave Onesimus. Drawing on insights from Scott Bartchy, Robert Wall argues that the issue had more to do with power relationships than with slavery. As a model for conflict resolution and mutual relations within the Christian community Paul&#39;s letter has much to offer the church today. In this careful study of Colossians and Philemon, readers will find introductions that discuss the letter&#39;s occasion and purpose, authorship, and other background information, as well as important theological themes. Passage-by-passage commentaries follow that seek to explain what each letter means for us today as well as what it meant for its original hearers.

He killed no fewer, and probably no more, than four or five men. For the most part he worked on ranches, notably those of John Chisum and John Henry Tunstall.

Kennedy, <em>An Unfinished Life</em>, Robert Dallek cemented his reputation as one of the greatest historians of our time. Now, in this epic joint biography, he offers a provocative, groundbreaking portrait of a pair of outsize leaders whose unlikely partnership dominated the world stage and changed the course of history. </p><p>More than thirty years after working side-by-side in the White House, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger remain two of the most compelling, contradictory, and powerful men in America in the second half of the twentieth century. While their personalities could hardly have seemed more different, they were drawn together by the same magnetic force. Both were largely self-made men, brimming with ambition, driven by their own inner demons, and often ruthless in pursuit of their goals. At the height of their power, the collaboration and rivalry between them led to a sweeping series of policies that would leave a defining mark on the Nixon presidency.</p><p>Tapping into a wealth of recently declassified archives, Robert Dallek uncovers fascinating details about Nixon and Kissinger's tumultuous personal relationship and the extent to which they struggled to outdo each other in the reach for achievements in foreign affairs. Dallek also brilliantly analyzes their dealings with power brokers at home and abroad&#x2014;including the nightmare of Vietnam, the unprecedented opening to China, d�tente with the Soviet Union, the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East, the disastrous overthrow of Allende in Chile, and growing tensions between India and Pakistan&#x2014;while recognizing how both men were continually plotting to distract the American public's attention from the growing scandal of Watergate. With unprecedented detail, Dallek reveals Nixon's erratic behavior during Watergate and the extent to which Kissinger was complicit in trying to help Nixon use national security to prevent his impeachment or resignation.</p><p>Illuminating, authoritative, revelatory, and utterly engrossing, <em>Nixon and Kissinger</em> provides a startling new picture of the immense power and sway these two men held in changing world history.</p></p><p><p>Robert Dallek is the author of <em>An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963</em> and <em>Nixon and Kissinger</em>, among other books. His writing has appeared in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, and <em>Vanity Fair</em>. He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>Two of historys most distinctive voices--literally and politically--clash while working for the same goals. The deep-voiced Eric Conger delivers a flat yet consistent tone to the historical narrative. Disappointingly, he uses no variation to differentiate the oft-imitated president or the German-American diplomatic advisor. Such vocal characterization would have enhanced the experience of hearing this solid, well-researched summary of the political challenges facing Nixon--China, Russia, Vietnam, and the ever-present Watergate. Even slight imitations would have added color. Still, listeners glean a decent understanding of Nixons demeaning and suspicious ways, Kissingers ego and interests in world negotiations, and the pivotal crises they faced.

My parents were arguing about something again, and I just wanted a quiet place to sit and be alone. Anyway, I looked out the window and saw Duke, our beautiful black German shepherd, in the backyard. Duke could sometimes be grumpy with strangers, but he was always a sweet little puppy dog with me. In the backyard, our small in-ground pool had frozen over, and Duke was walking on the ice.<br> <br>Suddenly the ice cracked, and Duke fell through.<br> <br>No one noticed but me. My parents were too busy downstairs, and my brother, John, was in his room. I ran out the back door and found Duke scratching at the edge of the pool, trying desperately to get out. I was small for my age, and I was skinny as a stick&#x2014;I used to wear thermal underwear under my clothes just so I wouldn&#x2019;t look like I was starving&#x2014;but still I found the strength to grab on to Duke&#x2019;s paws and pull him out of the water. He was shivering, and all four of his paws were cut and bleeding from scratching against the side of the pool.<br> <br>I took Duke inside and wrapped him in a towel, and I put some bandages on his paws, and I sat with him and held him until he warmed up and calmed down.<br> <br>Over the next two days I changed Duke&#x2019;s bandages four times. It was hard, messy work, and probably kind of painful for Duke. He didn&#x2019;t like it, and neither did I. And when I was changing them for the fourth time, a thought formed in my head.<br> <br>There has to be a better way.<br> <br>So I came up with an idea for these special bandage booties for Duke. The outsides of the booties were like socks, but on the insides I layered gauze pads that I could just take out and replace. I&#x2019;d slip them on Duke and pull them tight, and that would be that. At first, Duke didn&#x2019;t know what to make of the booties, and he&#x2019;d sort of clomp around in them and look at me as if to say, Are you kidding me with this? But after a while he got used to them and didn&#x2019;t seem to mind. I remember seeing him walk by in his little booties and thinking he looked so cute.<br> <br>I also remember thinking, Okay, they work. The crazy booties work. This is better.<br> <br><br> <br>Fast-forward thirty years.<br> <br>I was on vacation with my three young children, Christie, Bobby, and Jackie, in East Hampton on Long Island. One afternoon, the children and I were sitting on a bench outside a bakery on Main Street, eating ice cream. I watched as a man came out of the store holding two white cardboard pie boxes, one in each hand.<br> <br>The man tried to push the screen door open with his elbows, but it kept swinging back and nearly knocking the boxes out of his hands. Finally, he escaped the store. As he walked to his car, he stacked one box on top of the other and balanced them with one hand while digging around in his pocket for his keys. He got them out but dropped them on the sidewalk. Somehow, he recovered and made it into his car with his two pies still intact. It was a little adventure no one paid any attention to but me.<br> <br>And as I watched the man struggle with his pies, a thought formed in my head again. The exact same thought as when I was ten.<br> <br>There has to be a better way.<br> <br>And in that very moment, I saw it. Clear as day.<br> <br>As a mom, I baked a lot of cupcakes for my children&#x2019;s birthday parties and school events, and the only thing big enough to carry twenty-four cupcakes was a flimsy cardboard shirt box. I&#x2019;d put cellophane or tinfoil on top of the cupcakes, but inevitably the icing would get smushed.<br> <br>But what if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what if there was a box specially designed for the job?<br> <br>Something with, say, six sides and a little shelf that gave you two separate layers for pies or all twenty-four cupcakes? And maybe the shelf could come out and you&#x2019;d have enough room for a triple-layer cake! And what if the bottom popped up so the box folded up flat for easy storage, unlike those big plastic tubs that take up all the room in your cabinets? And what if it made life easier for moms everywhere who were constantly baking cakes and cookies and pies for school events and birthday parties and could never really figure out how to carry them?<br> <br>Why couldn&#x2019;t such a box exist?<br> <br>I grabbed the kids and rushed back to where we were staying. I found some paper and started scribbling drawings of the box. I spent the whole day reworking and refining the design. I saw the entire process in my head: how I could make them, what they&#x2019;d be made of, the many ways they could help out mothers like me&#x2014;everything. It was all there, in the air, waiting for me to pluck it out.<br> <br>Just about sixteen months later, the Piatto Bakery Box was born&#x2014;and it went on to become one of the most popular products of its kind, ever.<br> <br>That moment outside the bakery was an epiphany for me. It was the moment when I realized&#x2014;truly realized&#x2014;what I was really good at. You see, other people in the store and on the sidewalk saw the man struggling with his pies, but no one paid him any attention. No one saw what I saw. As far as I could tell, no one viewed the situation quite the way I did&#x2014;oh, there&#x2019;s a problem, so what&#x2019;s the solution? But for whatever reason, I did see it that way. It was just the way my mind worked in that instant. And it made me realize, like I never really had before, that this is who I am, and this was what I do.<br> <br>I see objects that aren&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>I solve problems no one asks me to solve.<br> <br>I look at life in terms of meaningful, positive, impactful change, even if it&#x2019;s just a better pie box.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m an inventor, and I make things.<br> <br><br> <br>This is the part of the book where I&#x2019;m supposed to tell you about all the things I&#x2019;ve made and everything I&#x2019;ve accomplished. Some of you may already know parts of my story, but many of you might not, so the idea is to set up who I am and give you a reason to keep reading. To be honest, I&#x2019;m not really thrilled about this part. How do you write about your successes without sounding like you&#x2019;re bragging?<br> <br>Some people get someone else to do it in a prologue or a foreword&#x2014;someone notable who can get away with singing your praises to the heavens. But I didn&#x2019;t want to do that, either.<br> <br>I want this entire book, start to finish, to be like a conversation between you and me. Like you&#x2019;re sitting with a friend, feet up on the sofa, listening to her tell a story.<br> <br>My whole life and career have been about having direct and heartfelt connections with the people who cross my path and grace me with their trust and attention. I&#x2019;ve spent thousands of hours on TV addressing hundreds of millions of people, and in all that time I&#x2019;ve done one thing and one thing only&#x2014;spoken straight from my heart.<br> <br>I want this book to be the same way. Just me, talking to you, straight from my heart.<br> <br>So here goes.<br> <br>My name is Joy, and I grew up in a working-class part of Long Island in New York. My father ran a bus company, and my mother took care of me and my brother, John. Things weren&#x2019;t always perfect in our house, but they weren&#x2019;t always bad, either. Growing up, I was insecure and not very popular. I can&#x2019;t say I was a quiet person, but I definitely wasn&#x2019;t flashy.<br> <br>The people around me, though&#x2014;they were flashy. My father, Rudy, who drove big lime-green cars and wore white boat shoes, and my mother, Toots, who liked to wear big stylish hats everywhere, and later on my husband, Tony, an aspiring singer and life of the party who wasn&#x2019;t really ready to be a father to our three children.<br> <br>In my thirties I felt like I was losing control of my life, so I took charge and made some changes, and I rediscovered who I could be.<br> <br>Then I invented the first self-wringing mop, and that changed everything.<br> <br>I called it the Miracle Mop, and in the early days my children and friends and family helped me build the first 1,000 of them out of the back of my father&#x2019;s auto body shop in Deer Park, Long Island.<br> <br>I convinced someone at QVC, a new electronic retail TV channel, to sell the Miracle Mop. And despite having zero TV experience&#x2014;and a terrible fear of public speaking&#x2014;I wound up on the air selling the mops myself.<br> <br>Not too much later, we were selling millions of Miracle Mops a year.<br> <br>How did I do it? How did I sell so many mops on TV?<br> <br>I did it by talking straight from my heart.<br> <br>After the Miracle Mop, I just kept seeing things that weren&#x2019;t there. I came up with the idea for a better, slimmer, more efficient closet hanger, which struck most people as an unnecessary solution to a nonexistent problem. A hanger is just a hanger, they said. Who cares about hangers? Well, I did, and so did a lot of other people with messy, overstuffed closets and nice clothes that kept ending up on the floor.<br> <br>I launched the Huggable Hanger on the Home Shopping Network, and it became the single best-selling product in the history of HSN&#x2014;and all of TV.<br> <br>More products followed, and more successes, and nearly all of my inventions earned the Good Housekeeping Seal, my own personal benchmark for quality. Fast Company magazine named me one of the 10 Most Creative Women in Business, and People magazine called me The Billion-Dollar Mom. Each year my appearances on the shopping channel HSN are beamed into more than 90 million homes.<br> <br>All told, I&#x2019;ve designed and invented more than $3 billion worth of products, all of them for people just like me.<br> <br>Still, my proudest achievement, besides my three beautiful children, is the little company I started back in 1991, Ingenious Designs. It grew big enough for me to employ more than 200 people, including two of my children (who aren&#x2019;t children anymore, and who gave up impressive careers of their own to come work with me). My mother, Toots, and my father, Rudy, also came to work with me, even after they were divorced (I did have to put them in different parts of the building). Over the years, other friends and family came on board, including, believe it or not, my ex-husband, Tony.<br> <br>I guess I look at the concept of family a little differently than some people. I believe that just because bad things happen in relationships doesn&#x2019;t mean there isn&#x2019;t something worth saving there. I believe in circling back to people and seeing the good in them instead of the bad.<br> <br>Yes, I&#x2019;m an inventor, and, yes, I&#x2019;ve sold a lot of products and won awards and all that, but if you want to know what matters most to me&#x2014;what makes me me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s family.<br> <br>So if you share my belief in the power of ideas and dreams and family, I hope you&#x2019;ll keep on reading.<br> <br><br> <br>I believe we are all capable of great creativity and great productivity and great achievement in our lives. I believe we can all make meaningful, impactful changes that will make the world around us better. We all have unique tools and talents and abilities that, when deployed with true passion and purpose and courage, can produce astonishing, magical results.<br> <br>I believe these things because I see how far I&#x2019;ve come with my own set of tools and talents and abilities&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s a lot farther than I ever dreamed I could go.<br> <br>Which brings me to the reason why I decided to write this book in the first place.<br> <br>You see, it&#x2019;s been a long and incredible journey for me, from skinny little Joy to single mother of three to the great here and now. And through it all, I managed to defy a lot of conventional wisdom, and I developed my own set of truths. Today, these truths are my core principles&#x2014;they are what I live by each and every day, in every aspect of my life.<br> <br>And any one of them, on its own, can help you make a meaningful change in your life.<br> <br>But taken together, they form a kind of guide that I use to make positive changes in the world around me. I call it my Blueprint.<br> <br>My Blueprint for a more joyful life.<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s what this book is about.<br> <br><br> <br>So, technically, this book is not a memoir or an autobiography, although it does tell the story of my life.<br> <br>And, technically, it&#x2019;s not a self-help book, either, though I certainly hope it proves helpful.<br> <br>To me, this book is a shared moment between me and you. As I tell you my stories, I want you to feel like you&#x2019;re right there with me, facing the same obstacles, figuring out solutions, taking the journey with me.<br> <br>Along the way, I&#x2019;ll pause in my story, but only when there&#x2019;s something really important I want to point out to you. It won&#x2019;t happen in every chapter, but close to it. I&#x2019;ll even use a little light bulb&#x2014;&#x2014;to help mark these moments. Because I want you to learn what I learned, exactly when I learned it.<br> <br>And in the end, after all the stories are told, we&#x2019;ll come back around to my Blueprint. We&#x2019;ll walk through it together, and we&#x2019;ll see if some of it might help you build your own brave and creative life.<br> <br>I believe it will.<br> <br>I know with all my heart that you can carve a beautiful, joyful path through the world. And I hope my story can inspire and empower you as you take on the most courageous task of all.<br> <br>Inventing you.</p><h2>Hans Christian Andersen: The Life Of A Storyteller</h2><p>The first English language biographer to have returned to the original Danish sources, Wullshlager creates a fascinating picture of Andersen as a deeply troubled man, as far from Danny Kaye&#39;s all-singing version as it is possible to imagine. Desperately sensitive, sexually confused and socially awkward, Andersen found grace and acceptance through the creation of a distinct and beguiling literary world, becoming, as was once said of Tolkien, &#39;the creative equivalent of a people&#39;. Wullschlager&#39;s achievement is to demonstrate the unity of his troubled life and and the soaring achievement of his work. He appears in this biography more various and more flawed, but also more convincing and more impressive, than ever before.</p><p>Jackie Wullschlager is Deputy Literary Editor of the FT, and one of their principal reviewers. Her last book was INVENTING WONDERLAND: THE LIVES AND FANTASIES OF LEWIS CARROLL, EDWARD LEAR, JM BARRIE."In my view it is the best book ever written about Hans Christian Andersen. If someone had asked me a couple of months ago which biography of Andersen was the best I would immodestly have said my own work, but today I would answer that the best book is the one written by Jackie Wullschlager. Not only is is a fuller and more comprehensive biography, but it is the first book ever to place Andersen in a contemporary European tradition and to measure him with a European yardstick." &#x2014;Elias Bredsdorff, Emeritus Professor of Scandinavian Languages at Cambridge <br><br>"[T]his spring, Knopf will publish a biography by Jackie Wullschlager, a writer for the London<i> Financial Times</i>, which may add to the few reliable studies available in English, the most notable of which is Elias Bredsdorff's . . ." &#x2014;Diana and Jeffrey Frank, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"Finely documented and insightful . . .

A long train ride from the north has landed her on Uncle June, Aunt Beula and Cousin Jack's farm--the same farm where Ernestine was born and where her mother grew up. The girl's initial shy inquisitiveness gives way to a comfortable confidence as anecdotes, mementos and her own imagination help her weave a tapestry of family ties that she'll treasure forever. Gloria Pinkney's text has a relaxed pace that is perfectly suited to the summer setting. Her characterizations are particularly well drawn, and her dialogue thoroughly convincing. In some of Jerry Pinkney's finest work, sunlight filters through his pencil and watercolor illustrations, imbuing them with a feathery soft glow. Rustic elements such as mule and plow, a pipe stove and Uncle June's beloved old truck create a vivid sense of time and place. The human figures seem to spring to life in several atmosphere-laden scenes, their expressive, down-home faces shining with surprise, admiration and love. In a similar vein, Donald Crews's nostalgic Bigmama's evokes the same fond sentiments through slightly younger and more rambunctious protagonists.

Ben Trask, current head of the Branch, had always had his share of bad dreams. Indeed, since the Yulian Bodescu affair twelve years ago, he'd had more than his share. And only half of them when he was asleep. The sleeping ones were of the harmless variety: they frightened but couldn't kill you. They were engendered of the waking sort, which were very different: sometimes they <i>could</i> kill and worse. Because they were real.As for this one: it wasn't so much a bad as a weird dream. And weirder because Trask was wide awake, having driven his car through the wee small hours of a rainy night into the heart of London, and parked it opposite E-Branch HQ ... without knowing why. And Trask was fussy about things like that; he generally liked to be responsible for his actions.It was a Sunday in mid-February of 1990, one of those rare days when Trask could get away from his work and switch off, or rather switch on. To the normal world which existed outside the Branch. It should have been one of those days, anyway. But here he was, at E-Branch HQ in the middle of the sleeping city, and in the eye of his mind this weird dream which wouldn't go away, this daydream repeating over and over, like flickering frames from an old monochrome movie projected onto a window, so that he could see right through it. A ghost film: if he blinked his eyes rapidly it would vanish, however momentarily, and return just as soon as he relaxed:<i>A corpse, smouldering, with its fire-blackened arms flung wide; steaming head thrown back as in the final agony of death; tumbling end over end into a black void shot through with thin neon bars or ribbons of blue, green, and red light.</i>It was a tortured thing, yes, but dead now from all of its torments and no longer suffering; unknown and unknowable as the weird waking dream which it was. And yet there was something morbidly <i>familiar</i> about it; so that watching it, Trask's face was grey and his lips drawn back in a silent snarl from his strong, slightly yellow teeth. If only the corpsewould stop tumbling for a moment and come into focus, give him a clearer shot of the blistered, silently screaming face ...Trask got out of his car into a sudden squall of leaden raindrops, as if some Invisible One had dipped his hands in water and scooped it into Trask's face. Muttering a curse as he turned up the collar of his overcoat, he glanced at the building across the street, craning his neck to peer up at the high windows of E-Branch. Up there he expected to see a light--just one, burning in a window set central in the length of the entire upper story which was the Branch--lighting the room which housed the duty officer through his lonely night vigil. Well, he saw the duty officer's light, right enough, and keeping it company, three or four more which he hadn't expected. But he saw more than the lights, for even the rain couldn't wash away the tortured, monotonously tumbling figure from the screen of his mind.Trask knew that if he were someone or thing other than who and what he was--head of a top-secret, in more than one way esoteric security organization--then the experience must surely scare the hell out of him. Except, well, he'd been scared by experts. Or he might believe he was going mad. But there again, E-Branch was ... E-Branch. This thing he was experiencing, it must be in his mind, he supposed. It <i>had</i> to be, for there was no physical mechanism to account for it. Or was there?Hallucination? Well, possibly. Someone could have got to him, fed him drugs, brainwashed him ... but to what end? Why bring him here in the dead of night? And why bring these other people here? (The extra lights up there, the shiny black MG Metro pulling into the curb, and the bloke across the road--an E-Branch agent, surely?--even now running through the rain toward the Branch's back door entrance.) Why were they here?"Sir?" A girl struggled stiffly, awkwardly out of the Metro. She was Anna Marie English, a Branch esper. English by name but never an English rose--nor any sort of rose by any other name--she was enervated, pallid, dowdy, a stray cat drowning in the rain. It was her talent, Trask knew, and he felt sorry for her. She was "ecologically aware"; or as she herself was wont to put it, she was "as one with the Earth." When water tables declined and deserts expanded, so her skin dried out, became desiccated. When acid rains ate into Scandinavian forests, her dandruff fell like snow. In her dreams she heard whale species singing sadly of their decline and inevitable extinction, and she knew from her aching bones when the Japanese were slaughtering the dolphins. A human lodestone, she tracked illicit nuclear waste, monitored pollution, shrank from yawning holes in the ozone as a coral polyp from a diver's probing spearpoint. Yes, she was an "ecopath": she felt for the Earth and suffered all of its sicknesses, and unlike the rest of us knew that she, too, was dying from them.Trask looked at her: she was twenty-four and looked fifty. Despite his pity, perhaps paradoxically, he thought of her in harsh, disassociated, almost disapproving terms--thick-lensed spectacles, liver spots, hearing aid, straggle-haired, crumpled blouse, splay-legged-and knew he disliked her because she mirrored the decline of the world. And that was <i>his</i> talent at work. Ben Trask was a human lie detector: he recognized a lie when he saw, felt, heard, or otherwise perceived one as other men recognize a slap in the face; so that, conversely, in the absence of falsehood he must acknowledge truth. Except Anna Marie English's truth was unbearable. If Greenpeace had her and could make the world believe in her, they would win their case in one ... though of course it would be lost at one and the same time. For they'd suspect that they were too late. But Trask also knew that it wasn't quite like that. The world was a huge creature and had been sorely wounded, and Anna Marie English was just too small to sustain so much damage. But while she was suffering almost beyond endurance, the Earth could go on taking it for a long time yet. This was Trask's view of it, anyway. He supposed it made him an optimist, which was something of a paradox in itself."Can you see it?" he said. "Do you have any idea what it's all about?"She looked at him and saw a mousy-haired, green-eyed man in his late thirties. Trask was about five feet ten, a little overweight and slope-shouldered, and wore what could only be described as a lugubrious expression. Perhaps it had to do with his talent: in a world where the plain truth was increasingly hard to find, it was no easy thing being a lie detector. White lies, half-truths, and downright fables came at Trask from all directions, until sometimes he felt he didn't want to look anymore.But Anna Marie English had her own problems. Finally she nodded her bedraggled mop of a head. "I see it, yes, but don't ask me what it's all about. I woke up, saw it, and knew I had to come here. That's all. But I've a hunch the world's a loser yet again." Her voice was a coughing rasp."A hunch?""This thing isn't specific to me." She frowned. "This time I'm just ... an onlooker? It isn't hurting me. I feel for him, yes, but his fate doesn't seem to have made much impression on the world in general. Yet at the same time, somehow I think it makes the world less.""Do you know him?""I feel that I <i>should</i> know him, certainly," she answered, simultaneously shaking her head. And ruefully: "I know that I was watching him when I should have been watching the road. I went through two red lights at least!"Trask nodded, took her by the elbow, and guided her across the street."Let's join them and see if anyone else has a clue." In fact he already had more than a clue but was unwilling to give it voice. If he was right, then just like the ecopath he could scarcely view this phenomenon as Earth-damaging. In fact it might even be a relief.With Whitehall no more than a ten-minute walk away, the torn front page from a discarded <i>Pravda</i> seemed strangely out of place where it spun slowly in the current of the flooded gutter, inching soggily and perhaps prophetically towards the iron-barred throat of a gurgling sump. But as if in defiance of the stinging rain, the night, and all other distractions, the phantom hologram continued to display itself wherever the glances of Trask and Anna Marie English happened to fall. It was there in the tiny unmanned foyer, playing on the neutral grey doors of the elevator as if projected there from their eyeballs; and when the doors hissed open to admit them, they took it with them into the cage to be carried up to the top-floor offices of E-Branch HQ.The rest of the building was a well-known hotel; bright lights at the front, and a uniformed doorman from the Corps of Commissionaires sheltering from the rain under his striped plastic canopy, or more likely inside taking a coffee with the night clerk now that all the guests were abed. But up here on the top floor ...This was a different world. And a weird one.E-Branch: Ben Trask felt much the same about it now as he had fourteen years ago when he was first recruited, and as every Branch esper before and since. Alec Kyle, an old friend and ex-head of Branch, was dead and gone now (<i>was he? And his body, too? Was that what this was all about?</i>), but he had come closest to it when he'd used to say, "E-Branch? A funny bloody outfit, Ben! Science and sorcery--telemetry and telepathy--computerized probability patterns and precognition--gadgets and ghosts. We have access to all of these things ... now."That "now" had qualified it. For at the time, Kyle had been talking about Harry Keogh. And later he had <i>become</i> Harry Keogh; Keogh's mind in Kyle's body, anyway ...The cage jerked to a halt; its doors hissed open; Trask and the unnaturally aged "girl," and the hologram, got out.<i>Hologram or phantom</i>? Trask wondered. <i>Gadget</i> ... <i>or ghost</i>? When he was a kid he'd believed in ghosts. Then for a time he hadn't. Now he worked for E-Branch and ... sometimes he wished he were a kid again. For then it was all in the imagination.Ian Goodly, the night duty officer, was waiting for them in the corridor. Very tall, skeletally thin, and gangly, he was a prognosticator or "hunchman." Grey and mainly gaunt-featured, Goodly's expression was usually grave; he rarely smiled; only his eyes--large, brown, warm and totally disarming--belied what must otherwise constitute a ratherunfortunate first impression, that of a cadaverous mortician. "Anna." He offered the girl a polite nod. "Ben?"Trask returned the unspecified query with: "Do you see it, too?""We all do," Goodly answered, his voice high-pitched and a little shrill, but not unusually so. And before Trask could say anything else: "I guessed you'd be in. I've told them to wait for you in the ops room.""How many of them?"Goodly shrugged. "Everyone within a thirty-mile radius."Trask nodded. "Thanks, Ian. I'll go and speak to them. And you'd better go back to keeping watch."Again Goodly's shrug. "Very well, but apart from this it's going to be a quiet night. This thing is happening, and soon it will be finished. And then we'll see what we'll see." He began to turn away.Trask caught his arm and stopped him. "Any ideas?"Goodly sighed. "I could give you ... an 'educated guess'? But I suspect you'd prefer to let it play itself out, right?" Like all hunchmen, he was cautious about being too specific. The future didn't like being pinned down.Someone had called the elevator; its doors closed and the indicator signaled its descent. As Goodly made to return to his watch, Trask uttered a belated "Right," then turned left along the corridor and headed for the ops room. And Anna Marie English limped along behind him.In the ops room they found their colleagues waiting for them. In front of the briefing podium an area had been cleared of chairs where eleven espers formed an inwards-facing circle. Trask and the girl made thirteen. <i>A witch's dozen</i>, he thought wryly. <i>We complete the coven.</i>As the circle opened up and its members adjusted their positions the better to accommodate the latecomers, Trask saw the point of the formation. The combined awareness of the espers added to the hologram's authentication: to experience the thing as a group was to focus it, lend it definition. And the hitherto nebulous mental projection expanded in a moment from a 3-D picture in Trask's mind's eye to a seemingly physical, apparently solid figure right there in front of him! But only <i>apparently</i> solid, for obviously it wasn't real.The ring formed by the espers was maybe fifteen to eighteen feet in diameter; the location of the smouldering corpse where it tumbled backwards, head over heels, free of the floor, as on some invisible spit, was no more than ten feet away from any individual viewer. If it were solid--if it were "here" at all--then the figure would have to be that of a child or a dwarf. But its proportions were those of a normal, adult human being. And so the apparition <i>was</i> some kind of hologram, viewed as from a considerably greater distance than was apparent. It was like a scene in a crystal ball: they were seeing something which had happened, or which was even now <i>in enactment,</i> somewhere else. Andmore than ever Trask believed he knew this ... victim? And more than ever he suspected that this was a scene from another world, even another universe.On entering the room, the head of Branch had noted the identities of the eleven. There was Millicent Cleary, a pretty little telepath whose talent was still developing. There seemed little doubt but that one day she would be a power in her own right, but right now she was vulnerable--telepathy could do that to a person--and Trask thought of her as the kid sister he'd never had. Then there was David Chung, a hugely talented locator and scryer. He was slight, wiry, slant-eyed, and yellow as they come. But he was British from birth, a Londoner, and fiercely loyal to the Branch. All of them were loyal, else the Branch must fail. Chung tracked Soviet stealth subs, IRA units in the field, drug runners--especially the latter. Addiction had killed his parents, which was where his talent had its genesis. And it was still growing.The precog Guy Teale stood to the left of Trask. Like Ian Goodly, he was "gifted" in reading the future, a suspect talent at best. The future didn't like being read and had kicked back more than once. Teale was small, thin, jumpy. Easily startled, he lived on his nerves. His sometime partner Frank Robinson, a spotter who infallibly recognized other espers, stood next to him. Robinson was blond as Teale was dark; boyish and freckled, he looked only nineteen or thereabouts, which was seven years short of the mark. The pair had worked with Trask on the Keogh job some six or seven months ago; they'd helped him corner the Necroscope in his house near Edinburgh and burn the place to the ground. That had caused Harry to escape right out of this world to a place on the other side of the Perchorsk Gate. Since when everyone who knew the score had prayed that he wouldn't be back.

The young knight starts off as a foolish, headstrong boy, but soon becomes one of Arthur's champions as he travels the land, besting opponents and rescuing distressed damsels. Younger readers will need help navigating the more oblique parts of the story, such as Perceval's encounter with the Fisher King, but there are still plenty of straightforward heroics to keep the pages turning. As with de Troyes' original, the tale ends abruptly and without resolution, and Perkins provides insight into story variations in an author's note. Throughout, Spirin's intricate full-color paintings, done in the <i>gesso</i> technique used by medieval and Renaissance painters, display a range of passions and action. A handsome volume, this may entice young readers to breach the much-storied lore of Arthur's court. <i>Ian Chipman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

No other figure in 20th Century science and medicine could be named who has been so badly maligned in popular media, scientific and medical circles, or so shabbily mistreated by power-drunk federal agencies and arrogant judges. Publicly denounced and slandered in both Europe and America by Nazis, Communists and psychoanalysts, placed on both Hitler's and Stalin's death lists but narrowly escaping to the USA, subjected to new public slanders and attacks by American journalists and psychiatrists who deliberately lied and provoked an "investigation" by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), imprisoned by American courts which ignored his legal writs and pleas about prosecutorial and FDA fraud, denied appeals all the way up to the US Supreme Court, which rubber-stamped the FDA's demands for the banning and burning of his scientific books and research journals, and finally dying alone in prison - who was this man, Wilhelm Reich, and why today, some 50 years after his death, does he continue to stir up such emotional antipathy? It is a literal 80-Years' War of continuing misrepresentation, slander and defamation. Who were and are Reich's attackers? And what stands behind their obsession to utterly rid the world of him, and of his work? What are the facts regarding Reich's social-sexual theories and his experimental work on the orgone energy, or life-energy? Natural scientist and former professor James DeMeo takes on the book-burners, exposing with clarity and documentation their many slanderous fabrications, half-truths and lies of omission. In so doing, he also summarizes the lesser-known facts about Reich's important clinical and life-energetic experimental findings, now verified by scientists and physicians in Europe, the Americas and other nations, which hold great promise for the future.</p></p><p>James DeMeo, PhD, formally studied the Earth, Atmospheric, and Environmental Sciences at Florida International University and later at the University of Kansas, where he earned his PhD in 1986. At KU, he openly undertook the first graduate-level natural scientific research specifically focused upon Wilhelm Reich&#39;s controversial discoveries, subjecting those ideas to rigorous testing, with positive verification of the original findings. DeMeo subsequently undertook field research in the arid American Southwest, Egypt, Israel, sub-Saharan Eritrea, and Namibia, Africa. His work on the Saharasia question constituted the most ambitious global cross-cultural research study to date, on the subjects of human behavior, family and sexual life around the world. His published works include dozens of articles and compendiums, and several books, including Saharasia, The Orgone Accumulator Handbook, and In Defense of Wilhelm Reich. He was editor of On Wilhelm Reich and Orgonomy and Heretics&#39; Notebook, and of the journal Pulse of the Planet, and co-editor for the German-language compendium Nach Reich: Neue Forschung zur Orgonomie. DeMeo served on the faculty of Geography at the University of Kansas, Illinois State University, University of Miami and University of Northern Iowa. In 1978, he founded the Orgone Biophysical Research Lab (OBRL), where he continues as Director. In 1994 the OBRL Greenspring Center was established, a high-altitude research facility in the Siskiyou Mountains near to Ashland, Oregon, exhibiting optimal conditions for sensitive orgone energy experiments. At the new OBRL facility, he continues with experimental work and writing, and hosts the occasional seminar.</p><h2>The Applause of Heaven</h2><p><p>It comes from God and it is within your reach ...

We were all older, sure, with expensive haircuts and finely tailored suits. The food was a lot better, and it was served on fine china, classic white with a platinum border. And then there was the view. Instead of a track or a football field, our windows overlooked the grand expanse of Fifth Avenue and Central Park. No trophy cases or spirit banners, either, just a vast Ellsworth Kelly painting and a few signed Chuck Close prints adorning the otherwise stark white walls. But these were just trophies of a different sort. <br>At Parsons Valentine &amp; Hunt LLP, every step you took was a carefully calibrated decision, right down to where you sat at lunch&#x2014;especially the year you were up for partner. The powers-that-be took meticulous note of who was allied with whom. If you regularly sat at a table to gossip and gab with other associates, it telegraphed <i>lazy</i> and <i>unambitious.</i> If you sat only with partners, it screamed <i>brownnoser.</i> Sitting off by yourself, not surprisingly, was the worst kind of professional suicide&#x2014;you might as well walk around wearing a big SOCIAL LIABILITY sign around your neck. And the worst thing you could be at Parsons Valentine was <i>unpresentable</i>. <br>At lunch in the Jury Box, we were spoiled for choice. I navigated my way around the freshly stocked salad bar, past the sushi chef, deli counter, brick-oven pizza and teppanyaki lines, and stopped at the hot entr�e station. Mason, the firm&#x2019;s executive director of Dining Services&#x2014;he&#x2019;d apprenticed at Le Bernardin&#x2014;was standing behind the sneeze guard, wearing his chef&#x2019;s hat and a crisp white apron. Mason was one of my favorite people at the firm. He&#x2019;d once sent a steak sandwich to my office when I was stuck on a late-night conference call. I&#x2019;d never forgotten it. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Mason, what are you pushing today?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Well, well. Ingrid Yung. My favorite customer.&#x201d; He gestured with a flourish at the row of silver chafing dishes. &#x201c;Today we&#x2019;ve got some beautiful seared ahi tuna steaks with avocado tartare.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hm. Sounds healthy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And over here I&#x2019;ve got my famous spicy three-cheese lasagna.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sold.&#x201d; <br>I walked my lasagna and a Perrier over to the cashier line. The guy in front of me, some fourth-year Litigation associate I&#x2019;d never spoken to, was busily scratching a client matter number onto a checkout form with a stubby yellow golf pencil. <br>Parsons Valentine attorneys had the option of paying for our Jury Box meals in one of two ways: cash from our own pockets, or charging it to the client whose matter we were working on. We were supposed to do this only when working late and bringing dinner to our desks, but a lot of lawyers just charged their meals whenever they felt like it. This meant that Microsoft might be springing for your breakfast bagel, while Time Warner picked up your turkey club at lunch. I always just paid cash. It was faster, not to mention more honest. <br>I picked up my tray, entered the dining room, and surveyed my options. <br>Jeff Murphy half-stood from his table, waving me over to where he sat with Hunter Russell, another associate in our class. Good old Murph. He was one of my best friends at the firm. We&#x2019;d shared an office as summer associates, exactly nine years ago this month. Frankly, I hadn&#x2019;t expected to like him much at first. I&#x2019;d taken one look and assumed he&#x2019;d be too entitled for my taste, the worst kind of irritating, backslapping, how-the-hell-are-you frat boy. But he&#x2019;d grown on me. Murph was a smart guy, despite the rich jock pedigree. <br>I set my tray down next to his on the starched white tablecloth and pulled out a chair. I nodded at Hunter, who barely glanced my way, thumbs frantically working the keys of his BlackBerry. Hunter loved his BlackBerry. It gave him the appearance of responding to urgent client messages while he checked his Fantasy League Baseball stats. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Yung?&#x201d; said Murph, jostling my elbow. He grinned at me, and I looked sidelong back at him. <br>Murph was a good-looking guy, and he knew it. I was reminded of this once again, seeing him in his crisp white dress shirt, open at the throat, sleeves rolled up, his tanned, muscular forearms lying easily on the table. His wavy, dark blond hair just brushed the top of his collar, and his new tan set off his eyes to brilliant effect, making them look even greener than usual. Murph&#x2019;s family had a house on the Cape, and he spent a week there every Memorial Day. He&#x2019;d just gotten back, and he practically glowed with privilege and well-being. <br>Murph and I had once had something of a moment, you might say, years ago. When you hire ninety-five young, smart, attractive, ambitious people every fall, who&#x2019;ve all just graduated from the same five law schools and landed in Manhattan, and then make them work twenty hours a day together in close quarters, there&#x2019;s obviously going to be sexual tension. Back when we were first-years, Murph had thrown a huge Halloween party at the loft he shared in Tribeca with one of his college buddies. I hadn&#x2019;t really wanted to go, and I didn&#x2019;t have a costume, but all the other associates in our class were going, and there was nothing I hated more than feeling left out. <br>So at the last minute, I rushed from work to my apartment and threw on my high school prom dress&#x2014;the one I&#x2019;d worn the night I&#x2019;d been crowned Potomac Valley High&#x2019;s first-ever Asian American prom queen. (Oh my! Mrs. Saltzstein, the guidance counselor, had gushed. She&#x2019;d heard of Oriental valedictorians before, but never a Chinese prom queen!) The dress was a strapless pink taffeta number. The zipper took some coaxing, and I was mushrooming a little out the top, but damn if I didn&#x2019;t still look pretty good in that thing. <br>By the time I cabbed downtown to Murph&#x2019;s loft, the party was in full swing. <br>&#x201c;Yung!&#x201d; said a very drunk Murph upon greeting me at the door. He was dressed as Pope John Paul II. We air-kissed&#x2014;funny how being at a party makes it okay to air-kiss your co-workers&#x2014;and he led me to the drinks in the kitchen. Many hours and margaritas later, Murph, Hunter, Hunter&#x2019;s wife, and I were huddled around his CD collection (this being before the iPod age) and someone put on &#x201c;Son of a Preacher Man.&#x201d; Murph looked at me, bleary-eyed, and said, &#x201c;Yung. What <i>are</i> you wearing?&#x201d; I batted my lashes and purred, &#x201c;My prom dress.&#x201d; Hunter&#x2019;s wife threw back her head and laughed. &#x201c;What about some fake hickeys? You can&#x2019;t be a prom queen without the hickeys!&#x201d; <br>Without missing a beat, Murph volunteered to provide the real thing, and before I could think better of it, Murph bent over my bare neck and shoulder and did the honors while I leaned back against his Sharper Image CD tower. I remember being surprised at the warmth of him, and how good the burr of his late-night stubble felt against my skin. It tickled, and I was laughing, and Dusty Springfield was singing that being good isn&#x2019;t always easy, but when Murph stood back up and gazed at me with a deadly serious, intensely hopeful look on his face, I realized I&#x2019;d made a grave mistake. Sure enough, later that night, as Murph helped me look for my coat among the huge pile on his bed, he fixed me with a solemn if drunken gaze and leaned in toward me at a deliberate angle. I gently disentangled myself and pretended to laugh it off. &#x201c;If only you weren&#x2019;t dressed as the pope,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, the easiest way I could think of to let him down lightly. This was <i>Murph,</i> after all; he was like my brother. Furthermore, everyone at work knew he was an incorrigible flirt. Monday morning we both acted like it had just been the tequila talking. That had been eight years ago. We&#x2019;d never spoken of it since. <br>&#x201c;Health food?&#x201d; Murph asked now, nodding toward my plate. <br>&#x201c;Shut up, it&#x2019;s delicious,&#x201d; I told him, and took a huge bite of lasagna. <br>I did not appreciate Murph or anyone else scrutinizing what I was eating. It always felt, just a tiny bit, like I was back in my fourth-grade cafeteria, shyly unwrapping the scallion pancake or shrimp toast my mother would pack in aluminum foil in my lunchbox. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s <i>that</i>?&#x201d; Becky Noble would wrinkle up her nose, her own tidy baloney-and-cheese sandwich raised halfway to her mouth, causing all of the other girls to giggle. Years later, on a blind date at the Campbell Apartment, my twenty-dollar martini had arrived alongside an appetizer of those same scallion pancakes, cut into dainty bite-size triangles and served with a ginger-soy dipping sauce. My blind date&#x2014;an anesthesiologist named Ethan&#x2014;pushed them toward me. &#x201c;Try one. These things are amazing,&#x201d; he enthused, popping one into his mouth. &#x201c;They <i>are</i> good, aren&#x2019;t they,&#x201d; I replied, smiling vaguely and wondering what had ever happened to Becky Noble. <br>Murph shook his head at me. &#x201c;I swear I&#x2019;ve never seen a woman eat so much and still be a size two, Yung.&#x201d; <br>I shrugged. <br>Here was another thing about all the male attorneys I worked with. They all called me by my last name, Yung, instead of by my first name, Ingrid. I wondered if some of them even knew what my first name was. But I didn&#x2019;t mind this. I&#x2019;d been in the corporate world long enough to know that it was a good sign. When they felt comfortable enough to swear like sailors around me, I knew I was finally in. <br>I looked over at Hunter. He was hunched over a piece of paper, scribbling on some sort of cryptic sketch that looked like a tree. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Hunter looked up. &#x201c;Oh. I&#x2019;m doing our softball brackets. See?&#x201d; He slid the paper toward me. &#x201c;This is how the season&#x2019;s shaping up. Wachtell&#x2019;s out. All we have to do now is beat Simpson Thacher in two weeks. And trust me, we will. They suck this year. So if Davis Polk takes down Skadden next week, and then they knock out the DA&#x2019;s office after that, we&#x2019;ll face them in the finals.&#x201d; He beamed. <br>Murph looked at me. &#x201c;Glad you asked?&#x201d; <br>Hunter was captain of our firm&#x2019;s softball team, the Parsons Valentine Prosecutors, and he was obsessed with winning the Central Park Lawyers League championship trophy. He spent twice as much time on softball captain duties as he did on legal work, but Hunter could afford to. He was pretty much unfireable. Nine years ago, during his final year of law school, he&#x2019;d had the good fortune to knock up the daughter of a longtime Parsons Valentine client. This bank CFO had promptly forwarded Hunter&#x2019;s r�sum� to the head partner in our Corporate Department with a lunch invitation and a handwritten note, gently suggesting that his new son-in-law was sure to be an asset to any firm. Hunter was hired the following week. He&#x2019;d been here ever since, billing about two-thirds of the hours the rest of us did. We grudgingly accepted him in our midst. We knew they&#x2019;d never actually make him a partner&#x2014;the firm was too worried about malpractice for that&#x2014;but he was assured a cushy job as a senior associate or Of Counsel for as long as his father-in-law&#x2019;s bank kept paying its bills. <br>&#x201c;A word to the wise,&#x201d; Murph said in a lowered voice. &#x201c;I hear Adler&#x2019;s looking to staff some monster deal. If you see him around, look busy.&#x201d; <br>We usually got assigned to deals at the Corporate Department meetings, so the process could appear fair and transparent, but sometimes partners just randomly trolled the halls looking for help. If you had too clean a desk or were blatantly surfing the Web when a partner poked his head in your office, you&#x2019;d be slapped with a new deal. This was known, resentfully, as drive-by assigning. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not Adler&#x2019;s MO,&#x201d; I said. Marty Adler was the top rainmaking partner at Parsons Valentine, the real deal. He didn&#x2019;t need to troll the halls. Associates wanted to work with him. If he liked you, he could make your whole career. <br>Murph shrugged. &#x201c;Look, believe what you want. I&#x2019;m just the messenger.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Speak of the devil.&#x201d; I nodded toward the other side of the room. Marty Adler, Harold Rubinstein, Sid Cantrell, and Jack Hanover&#x2014;heavy hitters, all of them members of the firm&#x2019;s Management Committee&#x2014;were rising from a table and pocketing their BlackBerrys. (Partners left their trays on the table for the dining room staff to clean up. Associates bused our own.) We all watched as this gang of four exited the Jury Box through the glass doors and stood talking in front of the elevators. Adler was gesticulating wildly about something. The others were nodding in agreement, apparently unaware that all of the associates were looking on. <br>I took another bite of lasagna. This brand of naked, unabashed partner worship amused me. We were senior associates, on the verge of our own partnership votes, and yet we still accorded the partners a distant, irreverent kind of celebrity&#x2014;sort of like the way kids talked about their teachers in junior high. Partners walked among us. We worked alongside them. We talked to them every day. But despite this charade of equal footing, they remained shrouded in mystery. They were beings to be scrutinized and revered, hated and loved&#x2014;and gossiped about. We were all expected to call them by their first names to their faces, but in private, we bandied about their last names only, as if they were baseball trading cards. <br>We watched as the four partners disappeared into an elevator. <br>&#x201c;Well, back to the grind,&#x201d; said Murph, balling up his napkin and tossing it onto his tray. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a ton of shit to do today.&#x201d; <br>Hunter pushed his chair back from the table and stood. &#x201c;Yeah, I guess I should get going, too.&#x201d; <br>Murph glanced at me. &#x201c;Hey, you don&#x2019;t mind, do you? You want us to sit with you til you&#x2019;re done?&#x201d; Actually, I did mind. Eating alone in the Jury Box made me feel like my cover had been blown. But I couldn&#x2019;t tell them that. &#x201c;Go, go, I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; I said, shooing them away. &#x201c;See you guys later.&#x201d; <br>I took two more bites of Mason&#x2019;s spicy three-cheese lasagna and stood to bus my tray. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My office was on the thirty-first floor, along with those of the other senior M&amp;A associates. Hunter&#x2019;s office was the first I passed on my way from the elevator bank. HUNTER F. RUSSELL <i>,</i> read the polished brass nameplate. Next to Hunter was Murph, and next to Murph was a seventh-year named Todd Ames, who&#x2019;d had his name legally changed from Abramowicz while still in law school. For ease of spelling, I&#x2019;d once heard him explain. <br>Hunter&#x2019;s, Murph&#x2019;s, and Todd&#x2019;s offices were all clustered together on the good side of the building, in a stretch of hallway known as Fraternity Row. They had scored these sweet offices with their panoramic views by flirting shamelessly with the firm&#x2019;s office logistics coordinator, Liz Borkofsky. It was rumored that Liz had taken this job in hopes of snagging a male attorney, any male attorney, on track for partner. Finally, last winter, she&#x2019;d gotten engaged to the firm&#x2019;s slightly shy, balding director of IT. The joke went around the office that Liz had slept her way to the middle. <br>I rounded the corner and got to my own office. It was nice enough, but it faced Madison Avenue, not the park. I&#x2019;d tried to make it a comfortable place to spend my waking hours, since we did spend almost all of them here. I&#x2019;d brought in a cheerful vase that I kept filled with fresh flowers. Vintage travel posters for the walls. And a framed photograph of the Manhattan skyline that I&#x2019;d once taken from the Brooklyn Bridge. <br>Margo was just getting back from her lunch break. Ridiculously, secretaries were not allowed to eat in the attorney dining room. Margo brought sandwiches from home and ate them in the park. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Margo,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How is it outside?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hot and crowded,&#x201d; she said, sighing. &#x201c;All those European tourists, you know.

It is a towering classic - intense, knowledgeable, and written with exacting care. Forty-seven years ago, when it was first published, it was far ahead of its time; today its insights into the behavior patterns of insects and feeding trout, its development of new and highly effective fly-fishing techniques, and its dramatic innovations in dry-fly dressing will remain valid and highly effective. Marinaro's reevaluation of the importance of terrestrial insects and his development of such patterns as the Jassid, the Ant, and the Pontoon Hopper expand the fly-fishing season far beyond the traditional period. His patterns, shown in full color, are widely acclaimed and used with striking success throughout the country. His valuable streamside studies remain models for anyone who would observe the most mysterious and intriguing of fish - the trout. Finally, A Modern Dry-Fly Code presents the first complete treatise on America's now-famous limestone waters, a generous ratio of practical lore and engaging reminiscence, and a profound rationale for the art of fly fishing.

The number one suspect is her hot-tempered husband, Stuart Gorman, who stands to inherit millions but steadfastly claims to have been miles away at his mountain cabin. Although attorney Gina Roake has never handled a homicide, she is eager to defend Gorman since his innocence seems so easy to prove. But things change quickly.

The author demonstrates having done meticulous research by interviewing friends, family, and colleagues--contemporaries who knew Tom Mix intimately and paints a vivid sense of who he was. Mix is seemingly forgotten by many Americans, yet he truly was a superstar in every sense of the word. This is even more amazing given that media weren't anything near as high-tech and real-time-oriented as today. He was internationally known for doing most of his own amazing stunts and traveling with his own circus/Wild-West show. The author also reveals that Mix's personal life was no less colorful with: five ex-wives, a huge Hollwood mansion, a fleet of luxury cars and a propensity to drink. Yet he maintained a squeaky-clean, super-hero-like public image. Some of his movies are available online and are worth the look--especially when you realize they were done in an era of few special effects. This book will motivate you to get your hands on these films. "The Last Trail", "The Great K&amp;A Train Robbery" and "Sky High" are great examples of surviving Tom Mix films.</p><p></p><h2>Painted Ladies (Thorndike Press Large Print Core)</h2><p>Hired by a museum to provide protection during a ransom exchange for a stolen painting, Spenser is personally outraged when the ransom fails and the painting is not recovered, a case that makes him question the innocence of the art scholar who retained him. (Suspense). By the late best-selling author of The Professional. Simultaneous.</p><p>Born and raised in Massachusetts, Robert B. Parker completed a Ph.D. in English at Boston University. He married his wife Joan in 1956. He began writing his Spencer novels while teaching at Boston&#39;s North-eastern University in 1971. In 1997 he wrote his first Jesse Stone novel, Night Passage. Parker was named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America in 2002.Series narrator Joe Mantegna clearly delivers Robert Parker&#39;s uncluttered writing and sharp dialogue. He conveys just the right notes of sarcasm and humor to capture both P.I. Spenser&#39;s cockiness and his more introspective side. In this novel Spenser seems more inside himself than usual as he works alone (Hawk is AWOL) to unsnarl a tangle of art thefts and moral challenges that have their roots in the Holocaust. The lovely Susan&#39;s frequent appearances offer needed breaks in the violence and help maintain the snappy repartee.

He doesn&#x2019;t count on Harlen Bigbear and his unique brand of community planning. Harlen tries to sell Will on the idea of returning to Medicine River to open shop as the town&#x2019;s only Native photographer. Somehow, that&#x2019;s exactly what happens. <p></p> <p>Through Will&#x2019;s gentle and humorous narrative, we come to know Medicine River, a small Albertan town bordering a Blackfoot reserve. And we meet its people: the basketball team; Louise Heavyman and her daughter, South Wing; Martha Oldcrow, the marriage doctor; Joe Bigbear, Harlen&#x2019;s world-travelling, storytelling brother; Bertha Morley, who has a short fling with a Calgary dating service; and David Plume, who went to Wounded Knee. At the centre of it all is Harlen, advising and pestering, annoying and entertaining, gossiping and benevolently interfering in the lives of his friends and neighbours.</p></p><p><b>Thomas King</b>, who is of Cherokee and Greek descent, is an award-winning novelist, short story writer, scriptwriter, and photographer. His first novel, <i>Medicine River</i>, won several awards, including the PEN/Josephine Miles Award and the Writers Guild of Alberta Award, and was shortlisted for the 1991 Commonwealth Writers' Prize. It was also made into a CBC television movie. <i>Green Grass, Running Water</i>, his second novel, was shortlisted for the 1993 Governor General's Award and won the 1994 Canadian Authors Award for fiction. His highly praised short story collection, <i>One Good Story, That One</i>, was a Canadian bestseller, and his collection of Massey Lectures, <i>The Truth About Stories</i>, won the 2003 Trillium Book Award. He has also written three acclaimed children's books: <i>A Coyote Columbus Story</i>, <i>Coyote Sings to the Moon</i>, and <i>Coyote's New Suit</i>. Thomas King lives in Guelph, Ontario, and is an Associate Professor of English (teaching Native literature and creative writing) at the University of Guelph.First novelist King, a professor of American and Native American studies and himself of Cherokee, Greek and German descent, sets his gentle, deliberate and ultimately engaging comedy about a group of contemporary Native Americans in a small Canadian community. Will returns to Medicine River, a town just outside a Blackfoot reserve, to bury his mother and reconsider his past. In short order he finds himself very much caught up in the present, opening a photography studio and playing on the local basketball team. His best friend and sometime coach, Harlan Bigbear, quickly convinces him to get involved with pregnant, unwed (and rich) Louise Heavyman. Will visits with Martha Oldcrow, the marriage doctor, and grapples with David Plume, just back from the protest at Wounded Knee. He meets other wanderers, from Joe Bigbear, Harlan's brother, a world traveler and storyteller par excellence, to Bertha Morley, who leaves the reservation to try her luck with a Calgary dating service. King's deceptively simple comedy is an intriguing portrait of Native American life today. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>the arabs: a history. eugene rogan</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Eugene Rogan is author of the bestselling The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, 1914-1920.

Although this seminal hoops franchise has not captured another NBA title since then, there has been no shortage of hardwood heroes in blue and orange. Bernard King kept the Garden rocking during the 1980s, and Rick Pitino brought renewed intensity and excitement when he took over as head coach later that decade.

Following 10 years of research, the author has uncovered the background and career of this elusive man of mystery, beginning with his origins in Cardiff. Binkie Beaumont was rarely photographed and avoided publicity, yet his company at one time had no less than 14 productions running simultaneously in London. He kept actors such as John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Vivien Leigh and designers including Cecil Beaton and Rex Whistler regularly in work.

Born into the lowest class of Byzantine society, she worked as an actress in burlesque theater. Yet she attracted the love of the future emperor Justinian, who, to the astonishment of proper society, made her not only his wife but also his partner in government. Justinian's respect for and trust in Theodora gave her power in her own right unmatched by almost any other Roman or Byzantine empress.</p><p>In this book, James Allan Evans provides a scholarly, yet highly accessible account of the life and times of the Empress Theodora. He follows her from her childhood as a Hippodrome bearkeeper's daughter to her imperial roles as Justinian's most trusted counselor and as an effective and powerful advocate for the downtrodden. In particular, he focuses on the ways in which Theodora worked to improve the lives of women. He also explores the pivotal role Theodora played in the great religious controversy of her time, involving a breach between sects in the Christian church.</p></p><p>James Allan Evans is Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of British Columbia.&#34;There is no other book that gives Theodora as extensive or as penetrating treatment as this one. . . . The task is worthwhile, because Theodora is a figure of historical importance and great interest and perhaps the only Byzantine woman about whom the sources say enough to make even a short book feasible.&#34; (Warren Treadgold, author of A Concise History of Byzantium)</p><h2>Cave Birds: An Alchemical Cave Drama</h2><p>Book by Ted Hughes</p><p></p><h2>Iron Man: Armor Wars Prologue (Marvel Premiere Classic)</h2><p>Iron Man battles villains in space, at the bottom of the sea in an underwater oil rig, and inside Stark Enterprises.</p><p></p><h2>One of Jackson&#39;s Foot Cavalry: His Experience and What He Saw During the War, 1861-1865 - Collector&#39;s Library of the Civil War</h2><p>This book is a facsimile reprint and may contain imperfections such as marks, notations, marginalia and flawed pages.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Rug Hooking</h2><p>A collection of patterns and techniques which enable the reader to make hooked rugs.

The instructional section explains the supplies and general techniques, from preparing the strips of wool (thrift-shop finds are a great source of material) to color planning and dyeing your own wools, and, of course, the hooking process itself. The specific project section is a bit too brief (only three projects are presented in full) and the pattern section somewhat vague (it consists only of color photos of six designs and the line-drawn renditions thereof), but the primer of general techniques is certainly thorough enough to get you started if you're keen on the craft. <i>--Amy Handy</i></p><h2>A Plan for Escape (Palabra Sur Book) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Henri Nevers is a French navel lieutenant sent to the penal colonies of French Guiana where he becomes intriqued by a mysterious Jew known as Dreyfus and faces the illusion of freedom</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)A Plan for Escape is a weird, engrossing novel, bound to captivate--if not totally satisfy--most readers. The story revolves around Henri Nevers, a Frenchman sent by his father to a post at a penal colony in French Guiana. Arriving at Cayenne, the seat of government, Nevers learns that the governor, Castel, has deserted Cayerme to "be alone with the prisoners" on the islands. When Nevers ferries to the islands, Castel meets him with delight as "an educated collaborator." Nevers intuits that "Castel's interest in social and prison matters is strictly sadistic," and he tries to remain uninvolved. Confronted by inmates' allusive remarks and his own observations, however, he is compelled to follow the clues that lead him to unearth the horrible results of Castel's reign. Despite the novel's horrors, its tone is eerily distanced by its point of view: The tale is narrated by Nevers' uncle who has pieced it together from his nephew's letters. This perspective allows for holes in the story which readers who demand closure may not accept. (What-they might ask-is Nevers' motivation for making his last, dangerous trip?) Other readers will enjoy puzzling over the small mysteries left after the main mystery is solved. Me relationship between prisoners and keepers is a dominant theme. As one character states, "Conscience and prisons are incompatible." This theme proceeds from Argentinian writer Bioy-Casares' reaction to accounts of Nazism in 1945, and it also-as others have noted--predicts the systematic tortures that would take place in his country in the 1970s. Translator Suzanne Jill Levine has done faithful and loyal service to make the novel available in English, as has Graywolf Press as part of its Palabra Sur series. Several pesky errors mar the edition (for one, "May name if Bordenave" for "My name is Bordenave"). Otherwise, this is a fine addition to the body of Latin American works in paperback. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Winning Quickly at Chess (Attack and Counter-Attack from move one!)</h2><p>Very good condition but it was a remainder book.</p><p></p><h2>Stolen Away: A Novel of the Lindbergh Kidnapping</h2><p>A fictional re-creation of one of the most enigmatic cases in American history follows one man&#39;s search through a maze of deception, betrayal, and danger to find the Lindbergh baby alive</p><p>March 1932.

In this full-color cut-and-assemble collection, architectural historian and papercrafter Edmund V. Gillon, Jr., has recreated five extant historic houses of the Colonial period. They include the Waite-Potter house, a typical one-room yeoman&#39;s cottage with sleeping loft and massive stone chimney, built in 1677 in South Westport, Massachusetts; the Eleazer Arnold house, with gabled roof, tall chimneys and lean-to built in 1687 in Lincoln, Rhode Island; the Ogden house, a typical &#39;saltbox&#39; - easily identified by the long sweeping pitch of its back roof - built around 1700 in Fairfield, Connecticut; the Tate house, an elegant merchant&#39;s mansion built in 1755 in Portland, Maine; and the Wentworth-Gardner house, a splendidly ornamented structure with pedimented lintels and a Georgian-style doorway, built in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1760. Complete instructions and clearly outlined diagrams show model builders of all ages how to cut, fold and score authentically rendered, carefully researched H-O scale models that will make excellent projects for home or classroom use.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Miracle, Solution and System</h2><p>Solution-focused systemic structural constellations for therapy and organisational change.

He lives in Vermont.Prologue<br><br>In the late summer of the last full year of the bloodiest war in American history, two men in butternut uniforms rode hard into the northern Vermont village of Kingdom Common, yelling and firing their rifles into the air. They galloped across the short north end of the rectangular central green, scattering a gang of kids playing one old cat on the grass under the tall New England elms, waking up the old men dozing on the porch of the Common Hotel.While one man held the horses, the other ran into the squat brick First Farmers and Lumberers Bank of Kingdom Common and demanded, in what a clerk later characterized as a Rebel- sounding&#x201d; accent, all of the gold on hand. He stipulated that he wanted only gold, the clerk remembered. Besides his rifle and two holstered pistols, he had eight white linen sacks for the clerks to fill. He made eight trips back outside to the horses, staggering under the weight of each sack. His companion, in the meantime, continued to holler and spout all kinds of threats, damning the Union army in general and Vermont Yankees in particular, and firing his rifle at random intervals. To this day there is a pockmark the size of a half-dollar partway up the granite clock tower of the courthouse, presumably from one of the stray bullets fired by the cursing raider.<br> The Gray Ghosts, as the two riders would become known in the mythology of Kingdom County, were not long at their work. At most, the robbery took ten minutes. No one had any idea who they were. They might have been Confederate soldiers hoping to divert Union forces to the north or common bandits disguised as Confederate soldiers. Still shouting, they galloped east out of town on the county road, then, it was thought, up the Canada Pike Road over Kingdom Mountain toward the border, five miles to the north. By the time the sheriff, a seventy-year-old Mexican War veteran who, at the time of the raid, was playing checkers at the feed store at the other end of town, had assembled a posse of other graybeards too old for active service and teenage boys too young, the raiders had a good half-hour start. Beyond the border, the pike road was just a faint trace, scarcely more than an animal trail through big woods and trackless bogs and bigger woods still, some of the last true wilderness east of the Rocky Mountains. It was not surprising that the Ghosts got away with their plunder scot- free.<br> The legend of the Great Kingdom Common Raid, however, was considerably enhanced by two unusual circumstances. First, the nondescript little country bank happened to be one of the wealthiest in northern New England, owing to the deposits of a number of local farmers who had paid substitutes to go to war in their stead and had made huge profits selling provender to sutlers to feed Union soldiers and horses. Astonishingly, the estimated take from the robbery was just under one hundred thousand dollars, all in double-eagle twenty- dollar gold pieces.<br> Second, so far as anyone could determine, neither of the rifle- toting raiders was ever heard from again, either north or south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Except for a few stray gold coins on the lower reaches of the pike road, not far from the Kinneson homestead, all traces of the riders, their horses, and the stolen gold seemed to vanish from the earth, leaving nothing but the legend of the treasure. The Treasure of Kingdom Mountain.<br><br>1 Miss Jane hubbell kinneson had lived all her life on Kingdom Mountain. Like her father before her, she enjoyed the reputation of being relentlessly old- fashioned.Winter and summer she wore long black dresses made from homespun wool. In the days when she was still farming, she worked her fields with oxen. She still raised most of her own food, and even Miss Jane&#x2019;s manner of expressing herself was old-fashioned. She delighted in using the antique phrases of her father and his Scottish ancestors, calling the brooks on her mountain burns,&#x201d; the valleys glens,&#x201d; and the trout char.&#x201d; During her years as mistress of the Kinnesonville schoolhouse, when families with children still lived on Kingdom Mountain, she referred to the students as her scholars. In recent years she had operated a small bookshop and lending library in the village, which she called the Atheneum, open three afternoons and one evening a week.<br> For the word certain,&#x201d; Miss Jane often said determined.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not entirely determined what to do with you scholars, but I shall give you fair warning. I won&#x2019;t abide slothfulness in the young.&#x201d; Abide&#x201d; was another of Miss Jane&#x2019;s favorite expressions. And she loved the word vex&#x201d; to denotte a frame of mind just this side of anger. Class, you are late in from recess again. How many times must I tell you that in this short life punctuality is all? Sometimes you vex me beyonddddd human endurance.&#x201d; As the sole proprietor and last resident of Kingdom Mountain, Miss Jane Hubbell Kinneson was vexed, and mightily so, by anyone who presumed to interfere in her affairs there. She was vexed by King James the First, whom she held personally responsible for the King James Bible. She was also vexed, though perhaps only mildly, by her title in the village, where she was known as the Duchess of Kingdom Mountain. Most of all, in the late winter of 1930, she was vexed by the proposed highway that would cut directly over the top of her mountain, linking Kingdom County and the rest of Vermont with the Eastern Townships of Quebec and Montreal.<br> Most Commoners, as the villagers called themselves in those days, referred to the new road as the Connector. Miss Jane called it the high road, no one was sure why. Maybe this was another of her beloved Kinneson anachronisms. Or perhaps she thought of the Connector as the high road because it would pass mainly through elevated terrain, skirting the river valleys where the villages and more prosperous farms were located. Then again, she may have wished to distinguish it from the tangled network of country lanes and dirt roads linking the hill farms and upland hamlets of the county one to another in the roundabout manner of the Kingdom of that era, where a straight line was almost never the shortest distance between two points. This much was certain: there would be nothing circuitous about the Connector. And there was no doubt at all that the proposed highway was a vexation Miss Jane Hubbell Kinneson would not abide.<br> Yet the Duchess was as unpredictable as she was stubborn. At the public hearing for the Connector at the Kingdom Common town hall, she listened to other farmers whose land would be confiscated inveigh against change in general and the new road in particular. She listened to her cousin Eben Kinneson Esquire, the wealthiest man in Kingdom County and the chief attorney for the highway project, present plans and maps and assure landowners that every effort had been made to route the Connector through higher, less valuable terrain. When her cousin Charles Kinneson, the editor of the Kingdom County Monitor, pointed out that the Kingdom&#x2019;s hill farmers valued their high mowings and mountain meadows as much as the valley farmers valued their river-bottom land, Miss Jane merely pursed her lips. Maybe she knew that protesting would do no good. Even as she sat in the little town hall listening to the debate, the right of way for the high road was unspooling northeast from the Common with something of the inexorableness of the glacier that, ten thousand years before, had carved out the hills and valleys of what would become northern Vermont. The hill farmers&#x2019; best hope now, their last hope, really, was that the Duchess, who for decades had held sway over Kingdom Mountain like a Russian empress, and whose words at town meeting still caused grown men whom she had taught as boys to quake in their boots, would speak for them. Wasn&#x2019;t Miss Jane widely believed to have second sight? Perhaps she would prophesy some magnificent catastrophe if the township went ahead with the Connector.<br> At last Jane rose. Tall and slender, with long, light hair and wide- set gray eyes, still a strikingly attractive woman at nearly fifty, she stepped into the sloping wooden aisle of the hall where, some thirty years earlier, she had delivered her high school valedictory, a scathing denunciation of small-town complacency and provincialism that had shocked the entire room into a prolonged and stunned silence. But instead of the expected denunciation of progress she said only, in her usual direct manner, I can plainly see that in this instance we shall have to render unto Caesar what&#x2019;s his. In Vermont, at least, this high road will go where it has a mind to go.&#x201d; While Eben Kinneson Esquire and the town fathers probably did not much relish being compared to a Roman dictator, it was with evident relief that Eben said, We appreciate your willingness to understand our situation, cousin. Particularly in your case, where this is such a personal matter. Of course we, I mean we the town, will take care to cross your mountain at the very farthest remove from your house and fields.&#x201d; You the town will do no such thing,&#x201d; Miss Jane said. I said, in Vermont the high road will go where it wishes. Kingdom Mountain is not in Vermont.Nor is it in Canada. It is an entity unto itself, every square foot of which belongs to me.&#x201d; Cousin, as I&#x2019;m sure you know, that notion has long since &#x201d; Hear me well, sir,&#x201d; Miss Jane interrupted. If I spy you or any of your legions on my mountain, I&#x2019;ll defend it by whatever means are necessary.&#x201d; It is difficult to say how such a declaration might have been greeted elsewhere. With applause, maybe. In the town hall of Kingdom Common on that long-ago March evening, Miss Jane&#x2019;s announcement was met with solemn nods of satisfaction. Eben Kinneson Esquire said nothing more. But not a soul in the room doubted that the battle for Kingdom Mountain had been joined.<br><br>Copyright � 2007 by Howard Frank Mosher Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin Company</p><h2>Sunny Bunny Tales (Max and Ruby)</h2><p>Spend your summer with Max and Ruby!

When faced with tough tests of character in (and out of) school, children are challenged to make the right choices. By using examples of problems kids face every day and providing four possible responses to each situation, Judge Judy helps readers build up their moral strength. For example, if your best friend's goofy-looking cousin is visiting and wants you to go skating after school, what should you do? <i>(a)</i> Tell your friend you wouldn't be caught dead with her. <i>(b)</i> Fake being sick to get out of it. <i>(c)</i> Go along with her; maybe she is really nice. <i>(d)</i> Buy her a mask. Parents and children are encouraged to discuss each answer, or even to make up their own, before deciding on a solution. But remember, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." As Judge Judy says, "Adults seem to have a little saying for everything... Don't bite off more than you can chew. You can't judge a book by its cover." In this fun and enlightening book, she helps kids apply these wise aphorisms in their everyday lives to make good decisions and get along with others.<p> Judge Judy Sheindlin is the outspoken author of several bestselling books, including <i>Judge Judy Sheindlin's Win or Lose by How You Choose</i>, which was also illustrated with Bob Tore's cartoonish line drawings.

She is the author or coauthor of more than 40 cookbooks, including <i>Gourmet Fish on the Grill, Healthy Grilling,</i> and <i>Grill</i> in the Williams-Sonoma Cookware Cookbook series. Ms. Grunes lives and works in the Chicago area.Part of the attractive and accessible Williams-Sonoma cookbook series, this volume focuses on the transformative powers of roasting. Grunes (Gourmet Fish on the Grill) suggests roasting anything from a pork tenderloin to a piece of bluefish to leaves of raddichio and endive. The elegant Sea Bass With Pernod, which calls for only six ingredients and a minimal amount of kitchen skill, makes a perfect dinner party dish. Even easier are Halibut Steaks Au Poivre, a spicy low-fat dish that requires about 15 minutes of kitchen time. Grunes even incorporates fruits, praising the "contrast of caramelized exteriors with soft interiors" of roasted apples and plums. A simple recipe for Roasted-Apple Brown Betty turns out a crumbly comfort that leaves a kitchen smelling divine (an optional Hard Sauce of sweetened whipping cream tops off the dessert). Best of all, like every Williams-Sonoma cookbook, this guide features beautiful photographs, clear instructions and a useful glossary, enabling even a novice to roast like a pro. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Katish: Our Russian Cook (Modern Library Food)</h2><p>Katish, round as a plum and neat as a pin, arrived in Los Angeles as a Russian emigre in the 1920s. As Wanda L. Frolov remembers, her house was brought to life by this humble genius of the kitchen, whose English was unpredictable and whose love of company (especially that of the downtrodden) was unstoppable. Soon Katish was nourishing the bellies and the souls of a happy throng with her blini and pilaf, her shashlik and borscht. On the side, she brokered marriages and started bank accounts for new emigres, presiding over all from her spotless pastry table.<br><br><b>Katish</b> offers deliciously simple Russian country cooking enveloped in a warm and cheering narrative, tender as the crust of Katish's own piroshky. It includes Katish's Cheesecake, one of the most beloved recipes ever published in <i>Gourmet</i> magazine.<br><br></p><p><i>Katish</i>, first published in 1947 and now reprinted in the Modern Library Food series, tells the tale of the plump, rosy-cheeked Russian �migr� who was hired as a family's live-in cook in Los Angeles during the 1920s. Katish brought with her not only savory recipes, but a cheery determination that was as nourishing as her blini and borscht. Told from the viewpoint of her employer's daughter, <i>Katish</i> is a bemused but also tender account of the life and times of the unstoppable cook who brokered marriages and started new bank accounts for fellow �migr�s, while offering dozens of recipes for the dishes she produced. The narrative reveals both a personality in full flower and a time and place in which the American domestic scene still supported live-in help and three square meals a day, enjoyed at a common table.<p> The book also traces Katish's Americanization: her first acquaintance with California markets and American butchers; her first car and electric refrigerator; and an American proposal. Punctuating the narrative are Katish's recipes for her special Russian Cheesecake, Pelmney (meat-filled dumplings served with sour cream), Easter Babka, and the hot yeast rolls and cinnamon buns that excited the marriage offer. A final chapter presents a small recipe collection "taken from Katish's own notebook" that includes a superlative Chicken � la Kiev. The recipes delight, but it's Katish's story, told with a keen eye for the life and times of a domestic celebrity, that makes the book a treasure. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"With Katish's recipes, you will eat the most sublime and comforting food.

In his book, you will find the knowledge of not only the stroke but also the setup, equipment, and mindset that will enable you to become the best putter you can be." -- Scott McCarron, Two-time winner on the PGA Tour, ranked 4th in putting on the PGA Tour in 1999 "Todd teaches the fundamentals of putting as simply and uncomplicated as anyone I've met. He understands the cause of what keeps people from putting their best and has the ability to communicate in a way that insures success." -- Robert Gamez, Two-time winner on the PGA Tour "I have had the privilege of working with Todd Sones for the last eight years. His simple and fundamental approach has been a great asset to me, and it will work for you. His book will enlighten you on how to improve your putting and lower your scores." -- Bill Harmon, Director of Big Horn Golf Club, Palm Desert, California, and one of <i>Golf Magazine's</i> Top 100 Teachers in America "Improved putting is the quickest and easiest path to lower scores. Golfers who really want to improve this part of their game can learn a lot from Todd Sones's approach. He covers all aspects of successful putting, including how to putt with a winning attitude, which is as critical as picking the right speed on a putt." -- Mike McGetrick, McGetrick Golf Academy, 1999 National PGA Teacher of the Year</p><p>"The man who can put is a match for anyone." -- Willie Park Jr., Two-time British Open champion Most golfers know the truth in that statement. Good putting can salvage a round of indifferent play from the tee and fairway or, conversely, faulty putting can ruin a great round of ball striking. Despite its apparent simplicity and humble exterior, putting might be the most difficult aspect of golf to master. When you think back to your best rounds, it is likely that your putting fueled your success; you made everything in sight and it seemed easy. Unfortunately, for most amateurs those days are few and far between. But there is no reason why it has to be that way. <i>In Lights-Out Putting: A Mind, Body, and Soul Approach to Golf's Game Within the Game</i>, Todd Sones--ranked as one of the top 100 teaching professionals in America by <i>Golf Magazine</i>--shares his secrets to success on the green. Sones has used the instruction offered on the pages of this book with amateur students as well as PGA Tour players. <i>Lights-Out Putting</i> teaches not just the proper fundamentals but also the mindset of a great putter--a lights-out putter. It teaches you how to enjoy the task of putting and to shift your focus toward the many putts you make in a given round--not the ones that lip out or go screaming past the hole. In this book you will learn the elements of a proper setup and--more important--the intangible asset known as feel, which enables a player to consistently gauge how hard or soft to hit a given putt. Sones also covers topics such as how to find the right putter for your setup, reading greens, prestroke routine and strategy, tactics, and practice drills. Beautifully illustrated with instructional photographs and sidebars, this complete book on putting will help all readers--from scratch player to high handicapper--develop their most critical ingredient to lower scoring.<b>Todd Sones</b> has earned a reputation as one of the most knowledgable teaching professionals in the United States, with such noted clients as Robert Gamez and Scott McCarron.

During World War II Anderson flew with Chuck Yeager in the famed 357th Squadron where he became a triple ace by shooting out of the sky fifteen enemy planes. Following World <p> War II, Anderson became a test pilot and later commanded jet fighter squadrons in South Korea and Okinawa. Then, in 1970, at an age when most pilots have long-since retired, Anderson flew combat strikes over Vietnam.</p></p><p>Anderson, a California farm boy who loved hot cars and airplanes, earned his wings in the Army Air Corps in September 1942 and flew P-39s. Sent to Europe in 1944, his squadron traded in their P-39s for P-51 Mustangs. Anderson flew 116 missions with the Mustang and shot down 17 enemy planes without receiving a single hit to his own plane. He also served in the Korean War and Vietnam, and as a test pilot. In the course of his 30-year career in the Air Force he was decorated 25 times. Hamelin, a sportswriter, does a highly credible job of telling Anderson's story. He skillfully interweaves anecdotes by men who flew with Anderson, such as fellow World War II section leader Chuck Yeager. Anderson's accounts of some of the projects he flew as a test pilot, as well as his candid remarks on the early space and high altitude programs give the reader an insider's view. An exceptional account of an exceptional man. Highly recommended. Photos not seen.<br><i>- George F. Scheck, Naval Underwater System Ctr. Lib., Newport, R.I.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Anderson flew P-51 Mustangs in the WW II European theater and shot down 17 German planes. Writing with freelancer Hamelin, he here relates his spectacular aerial confrontations with Messerschmitts and Focke-Wulfs, defines (in understandable technical detail) what "combat flying skill" really means and conveys the unique mindset a fighter pilot needs in order to survive. Anderson, who became an Air Force test pilot during the postwar "golden age of flight testing," recalls hair-raising incidents highlighting the challenge and risk of such work. After an onerous tour of desk-duty in Washington ("A colonel at the Pentagon is nothing but a glorified clerk"), he became one of the few fighter pilots to serve in combat both in WW II and Vietnam. This is an entertaining and instructive book for hardcore air combat buffs, who will find particularly interesting Anderson's comparisons between flying prop-driven Mustangs and high-performance jets in enemy skies.

It is an ingenious and emotionally powerful debut performance from literary detective and former bookseller Ariel S. Winter, one that establishes this talented newcomer as a storyteller of the highest caliber.</p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: Essay by Author Ariel S. Winter</b></p> <p>It is impossible to say when a book begins. Did it start at birth, or when I learned to read, or when I set out the first words that grew into a novel?</p> <p>I am inclined to say that <em>The Twenty-Year Death</em> began when I took two university courses: Hardboiled Fiction and Film Noir, and Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and Hemingway, even though I wrote it many years later.</p> <p>But perhaps the truer answer lies with that Chandler send-up, <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</em>, my favorite movie of childhood...and still today?</p> <p>What I do know is that <em>The Twenty-Year Death</em> is not the book I set out to write.</p> <p>That ambitious book was meant to be David Mitchell's <em>Cloud Atlas</em> as written by W.G. Sebald. There would be a straightforward first-person narrator, a close approximation of myself, and there would be the books the narrator read. These books would appear in full, so the reader of the novel would read the reading of the narrator&#x2014;mysteries, romances, westerns, sci fi, and "literary" fiction, his taste would be catholic.</p> <p>I began the frame narrative, and then I wrote the Georges Simenon pastiche <em>Malniveau Prison</em>, a one-hundred and fifty page replica of an Inspector Maigret mystery.</p> <p>I didn't stop there. Next up was a romance, a love story between the full-sized daughter of retired circus midgets and a newcomer to their island home. Oh, I was ambitious.</p> <p>And the book failed.</p> <p>Still I clung to <em>Malniveau Prison</em>. No writer, especially one young and unpublished, can bear to see his hard-earned work go to utter waste. I didn't have my novel, but I had a novella, and I knew it was good.</p> <p>I sent it to an agent. It was January 1st when he got back to me. Or that is how I remember it at least, and it has the poetic ring that appeals to me as a novelist.</p> <p>"I liked it a lot," he said. "But it feels like a half-novel."</p> <p>That was all the encouragement I needed. I attacked <em>Malniveau Prison</em>, and it doubled in size.</p> <p>There was talk of a series, but I didn't want to write a series. Unless...unless...what if the recurring character in the novel was not the detective, but some other side character...</p> <p>The American writer Shem Rosenkrantz seemed the obvious choice. And where would a great American novelist go after France...</p> <p>Hollywood, of course. And Hollywood meant Chandler. After all, I had one pastiche on my hands. Why not two?</p> <p>Before I even began on the Chandler pastiche, I had conceived of the Jim Thompson book as the novel's logical conclusion.

He also discusses those obscure elephant hunters who shot as many if not more tuskers but who are not as well known, simply because they never wrote books on their adventures. These intrepid hunters include Aurelio Rossi, Otto Krohnert, Billy Pickering, and Theodore Lefebvre and Etienne Canonne (Frenchmen who hunted in West Africa). The late Harry Manners, also a very famous hunter himself, wrote a chapter on Tony Sanchez&#39;s elephant-hunting escapades-the last piece Manners ever wrote and something that has never before been published. Parading in and out of the pages of this fascinating book are the most famous and illustrious characters to have been drawn to the mysterious Dark Continent in search of riches. Only a handful left Africa with more money than they came with, quite a few left with a lot less, and some paid the ultimate price. Being an ivory hunter was never easy, and making a living off it was a major feat in itself! However, in terms of sheer adventure and excitement, no other job on earth could ever come close to the ultimate fulfillment of hunting after Africa&#39;s white gold. Illustrated with dozens and dozens of period photos from long-forgotten archives, Tony&#39;s book puts a human face on these adventurers from a bygone era. It is certainly the most interesting tale ever to emerge on that intrepid and now finished breed of man-those Elephant Hunters, Men of Legend.</p><p></p><h2>TOYOTA LAND CRUISER GOLD PORTFOLIO 1956-1987: Road Test Book</h2><p>This is a book of contemporary road and comparison tests, new model introductions, technical &amp; specification data, driving impressions, on and off road tests, long-term reports and buying second hand. Models covered include FWD Pick-up, Station Wagon, LX, De Luxe, Petrol and Diesel. The first Land Cruiser appeared at about the same time as the Land-Rover. Styling changes occurred in 1952 with the modern range designated F25s and F28s. The FJ43 appeared in the mid-1960s, the 40 and 45 Series in Australia in 1967/8. The FJ55 was introduced in 1969, the 43 series continued to be made in Japan and the 40 and 45 Series had improvements made throughout the 1970s. Production of the FJ55 ceased in 1980 to be followed by the Series 60. This was only available with an in-line, six-cylinder engine of 3980cc. A generous five-seater, and good load carrier, there were few changes made to it after production commenced.</p><p></p><h2>Top Secret / Majic</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p>Friedman, a nuclear physicist and noted "UFOlogist" (Crash at Corona: The Definitve Study of the Roswell Incident, Marlowe, 1994), examines the documentary evidence for the existence of a clandestine government group called "Majestic-12" (sometimes shortened to "MJ-12" or "Majic"), supposedly formed in 1947 to deal with the remains of a crashed flying saucer near Roswell, New Mexico. The U.S. government has consistently denied there ever was such an incident or group. Friedman attempts to authenticate purported MJ-12 documents that mysteriously appeared in 1984 and 1994. He also refutes arguments by debunkers such as Carl Sagan and Phillip Klass and criticizes the findings in Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt's recent The Truth About the UFO Crash in Roswell (LJ 6/1/94). Included here for the first time is part of a 1984 "Special Operations Manual" for the recovery and disposal of extraterrestrial entities and technology. If authenticated, it would lend credence to Friedman's belief in a governmental cover-up he terms a "cosmic Watergate." While this book is speculative to some degree, Friedman operates mostly as a scientist, carefully weighing all evidence before coming to a conclusion. Recommended for public and academic libraries.?Gary D. Barber, SUNY at Fredonia Lib.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Majestic-12 documents are controversial adjuncts to the now famous UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Obtained under unusual circumstances, they refer to a top-secret research operation created by President Truman to coordinate the study of debris and alien bodies recovered from the crash site. Although the documents are considered by many historians and ufologists to be hoaxes, Friedman has studied them intensively and answers criticisms in great detail. He reviews the most recently discovered document, an alleged 1954 manual for the recovery and disposal of extraterrestrial entities and technology, as well as the notorious "alien autopsy" film that was broadcast on the Fox network in 1995. This book will delight those who can't get enough of crashed saucers and government cover-ups. <i>George Eberhart</i></p><h2>Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle</h2><p>Brand New.

A number-one bestseller in Israel, <i>Spinoza and Other Heretics</i> is made up of two volumes--The Marrano of Reason and The Adventures of Immanence. Yirmiyahu Yovel shows how Spinoza grounded a philosophical revolution in a radically new principlethe philosophy of immanence, or the idea that this world is all there is--and how he thereby anticipated secularization, the Enlightenment, the disintegration of ghetto life, and the rise of natural science and the liberal-democratic state.</p><br><p> The Adventures of Immanence:</p><br><p> Here Yovel discloses the presence of Spinoza's philosophical revolution in the work of later thinkers who helped shape the modern mind. He claims it is no accident that some of the most unorthodox and innovative figures in the past two centuries--including Goethe, Kant, Hegel, Heine, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Einstein--were profoundly influenced by Spinoza and shared his view that immanent reality is the only source of valid social and political norms and that recognizing this fact is necessary for human liberation.</p><br><p> But what is immanent reality, and how is liberation to be construed?

As she writes with obvious affection for these unforgettable characters, Ayelet Waldman skillfully interweaves life&#x2019;s finer pleasures&#x2014;music and literature&#x2014;with the more mundane joys of living. Within these resonant pages, a vase filled with wildflowers or a cold beer on a hot summer day serve as constant reminders that it&#x2019;s often the little things that make life so precious.</p><p><strong>Pat Conroy Reviews <em>Red Hook Road</em></strong> <p><b>Pat Conroy is the author of nine previous books: <em>The Boo</em>, <em>The Water is Wide</em>, <em>The Great Santini</em>, <em>The Lords of Discipline</em>, <em>The Prince of Tides</em>, <em>Beach Music</em>, <em>My Losing Season</em>, <em>The Pat Conroy Cookbook: Recipes of My Life</em>, and <em>South of Broad</em>. His newest book, <em>My Life In Books</em>, will be published in September. He lives in Fripp Island, South Carolina. Read his review of <em>Red Hook Road</em>:</b></p> <p></p> <p>In her latest novel, <em>Red Hook Road</em>, Ayelet Waldman has nailed the indelible mark that the state of Maine leaves on all visitors who fall for its subtle, insinuating glamour. <em>Red Hook Road</em> is a terrific novel, and might even be a great one. The structure of the book seems perfect to me; the first sentence sets up and readies us for the immense powers of the last one. It tells the stories of two families as different as the Montagues and the Capulets, but with the same tragic and irreversible destines playing out around them. The hardscrabble, working-class Hewins are native Mainers, the kind of family that keeps Maine vibrant during the cold months when the summer people return to their big-city homes. The Kimmelbrods are a sophisticated Jewish family from Manhattan; they are as cultured and passionate as the Hewins are no-nonsense and taciturn, as taciturn as lichens growing on the rocks of a church garden. Jane Hewins is a quintessential woman of Maine with an unviable sense of self and a home-bound integrity that could earn her a place on a Maine license plate along with a moose, a lobster, or a loon. Her big-city counterpart is Iris Copaken, a character who represents the highest level of Jewish culture. Iris has been vacationing with her family in Red Hook since birth, and Jane Hewins has cleaned the Copaken&#x2019;s summer house for many years. The novel begins when Jane&#x2019;s admirable son marries Iris&#x2019; delectable daughter; and great storm clouds form on the far horizon as Down East Maine meets the Upper East side in a glorious clash of the Titans.</p> <p>Ayelet Waldman&#x2019;s prose style is lovely and fresh. There is a brilliant scene that I&#x2019;ve returned to again and again: The great violinist, Emil Kimmelbrod, finds the undiscovered talent of a small girl, Samantha Phelps, and brings out her instinctive mastery of rhythm, modulation, and perfect pitch. With language and example, Ayelet teaches me everything I didn&#x2019;t know and can never know about music. It was like discovering a lost part of my life where I&#x2019;m not only untalented, but unteachable. Each encounter of Kimmelbrod and Samantha in the book was exciting for me. Had I not read this book, I wouldn&#x2019;t have understood that I&#x2019;ve never really "heard" classical music before.</p> <p>The structure of <em>Red Hook Road</em> is so perfect that I didn&#x2019;t initially notice the sacred reverence for the beauty of wood both families share. The people of coastal Maine are aficionados of wooden boats, and their harbors fill up with boats that perform the same service as the highest works of art. The same joy of perfect woodwork manifests itself in Kimmelbrod as he cradles his Dembovski or considers the famous violins of Giussupe Guarneri del Gesu. You learn in this book that there is a strange kinship in the mahogany fittings of yachts and the lacquered pear wood of violins--<em>Red Hook Road</em> is an intricate dance between art and nature, between foreignness and belonging, between still waters and storm.</p> <p>There are love stories being told all over this book, and like all great love stories, these are volatile and enduring and bright with astonishment. These characters now take up residence in the city I&#x2019;ve built out of the books I love. This book made me happy, and happy to be alive. It took me out of my home on the coast of South Carolina, placed me in the town along <em>Red Hook Road</em>, and changed me the way good books always do.</p> <br> <strong>Ayelet Waldman on <i>Red Hook Road</i></strong> <br> <p> </p><p>There comes a moment at every literary event, a moment every author dreads, when the lights go up and the Q&amp;A starts. The vast majority of the Q is fine (I can&#x2019;t speak for the A, you&#x2019;ll have to be the judge). What book am I reading now, when did I first want to become a writer, how do my children feel about the title of my last book. I like those Qs. I like especially the Qs that haven&#x2019;t been asked before, the ones that give me a chance to depart from my practiced answers. I&#x2019;m not as fond of the Q that begins with some version of, "I hated this book, but not as much as I loathed your last one," but I can handle that. (I find it usually helps to agree with the person and to suggest alternatives. Ian McEwan never disappoints.) The Q I loath and despise, the Q every single writer I know loathes and despises, is this one:</p> <p>Where, the reader asks, do you get your ideas?</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a simple question, and my usual response is a kind of helpless, "I don&#x2019;t know." But I do know. I&#x2019;m just embarrassed to tell you. I get my ideas from you, or from your mother, or from someone else I run across to whom something bizarre or sad has happened, someone whose life is miserable, but in an interesting way. "Write What You Know," goes the old adage, but once you&#x2019;ve written about what an unloved geek and freak you were in high school (and every writer I know claims to have been the most unhappy teenager who ever lived. Where were these people when I was sitting alone at the lunch table at George Washington Jr. High? I&#x2019;d like to know. Couldn&#x2019;t we have been sitting together?), once you&#x2019;ve mined the exciting tale of your grandmother/grandfather&#x2019;s immigration to America from Russia/Italy/China/Vietnam, once you&#x2019;ve spent an entire novel complaining about how much it sucks to have to wake up in the middle of the night with the baby, then what?</p> <p>I&#x2019;ll tell you what. Other people&#x2019;s misfortune. That&#x2019;s where we get those ideas that inspire us (and, we hope, you). Most writers spend their lives standing a little apart from the crowd, watching and listening and hoping to catch that tiny hint of despair, that sliver of malice, that makes them think, Aha, here is the story.</p> <p>My new novel, <i>Red Hook Road</i>, began many years ago as a short article in the newspaper. A bride and a groom (or was it the groom and the best man?) were killed on their way from the church to the reception, when a speeding car smashed into their limousine. The horror of that happening on that day, at that moment, when you are about to embark on a completely new life, where everything is possible and the future is all that is on your mind... that stuck with me for years. I&#x2019;d think of it time and again, as anyone would. </p> <p>A normal person thinks about that tragedy, and maybe gets sad all over again. A writer thinks of it and wonders, "Can I use this?"</p> <p>Until one day, you can, and you do. <em>--Ayelet Waldman</em></p> <p>(Photo � Reenie Raschke)</p>AYELET WALDMAN is the author of <i>Daughter&#x2019;s Keeper</i>, <i>Love and Other Impossible Pursuits</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Bad Mother</i>.

In a way we gambled a little heavier than some people do at Las Vegas, but we always got away with it.</i><br><br><b> HAROLD LLOYD</b><br><br> (Born in Burchard, Nebraska, 1893&#x2014;Died 1971)<br><br> There are few more fondly remembered screen images than the young man with horn-rimmed glasses desperately clinging to the hand of a clock high over Los Angeles. That young man was seventy-six years old the night he joined twenty aspiring filmmakers who had earlier seen a thirty-five-millimeter print of Kid Brother in the old library of the Doheny estate in Beverly Hills. For most of them this was their first look at Harold Lloyd, a comic genius whose screen triumphs four decades earlier had made him one of the world&#x2019;s most famous faces, an international star who produced his films and took responsibility for every detail. He never took director credit, but he was the guiding light of his comedies.<br><br> Lloyd owned his films and preserved them, but kept such a tight grip on them that he missed the opportunity for the kind of revivals enjoyed by his contemporary rivals, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. In fact, most filmgoers remember him only for the famous clock scene in Safety Last! because it is seen so often in film history compilations. But in the 1920s audiences crowded into theaters and howled at Lloyd&#x2019;s antics in Grandma&#x2019;s Boy, Girl Shy, The Freshman, The Kid Brother and Speedy&#x2014;which were always accompanied by a live orchestra. I remember Lloyd insisting that a piano was all right for two-reelers, but you had to have a big orchestra for features.<br><br> He was slight at five foot nine, optimistic and genial. When he arrived at AFI he seemed more like someone&#x2019;s happy uncle than a man whose success had enabled him to build a forty-four-room house in Beverly Hills with a hundred-foot waterfall, a nine-hole golf course and a staff of sixteen full-time gardeners.<br><br> Lloyd gave the world thrills and laughs. His era was the magical time of grand movie palaces, huge audiences and shared laughter, and his legacy includes some of the finest comedies ever made. It&#x2019;s just as well that Lloyd, a perfectionist who died two years after his AFI seminar, didn&#x2019;t live to see the postage-stamp screens of the modern shopping mall.<br><br> I invited him to be AFI&#x2019;s first speaker because I felt it important to establish this series with a pioneer who went back to the roots of American filmmaking, a pioneer who understood the importance of AFI&#x2019;s goal of preserving our motion picture heritage.<br><br> Lloyd&#x2019;s friend and colleague King Vidor joined the fellows in the questioning.<br><br><b> HAROLD LLOYD</b><br><br><b> September 23, 1969</b><br><br> May I just say that being a guest here tonight, I feel highly honored being in on the initial shove-off, as it were, of the AFI Conservatory. Certainly I&#x2019;m sure that everyone here, every guest you have, is rooting that it&#x2019;s going to go tremendous places. I&#x2019;m happy to say that I have the honor also of being one of the original men on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and to tell the truth, I don&#x2019;t believe it was as big as this when we started. I was on the original board that elected Doug Fairbanks, Sr., president, and it has gone quite a ways, so I&#x2019;d say that if your institute here gathers momentum and keeps going, you may well outdistance the Academy Awards. I hope that takes place.<br><br> This picture that you&#x2019;ve just seen, Kid Brother, well, we had a little problem with that one. It is what I call a &#x201c;character comedy.&#x201d; I made two different types of pictures. I made what we call &#x201c;gag pictures,&#x201d; for instance Safety Last!, where I climbed a building and hung on a clock. But Kid Brother is more what I call a character comedy because we start slow, we plant the character, we very carefully try and let it grow, letting the picture gain momentum as it goes on through to the end. I think we accomplished that. Now, where we took quite a chance with Kid Brother was in putting a fast-moving half-hour composite at the front of it with mostly comedy business and gags. After you&#x2019;ve gone that length of time and then stop&#x2014;and start a picture from scratch to build your character&#x2014;you are taking quite a chance.<br><br> <b> I used to hear stories about how adroit you and the cameramen were at slowing down right in the middle of a scene. Did you have the same cameraman with you all the time?</b><br><br> Yes, Walter Lundin. He was with me for years and years.<br><br><b> These were all done with hand-cranked cameras?</b><br><br> That&#x2019;s right.<br><br><b> I was amazed at the scene with the bus running through what seemed to be normal traffic. They must have had everything else on the street move at a snail&#x2019;s pace.</b><br><br> No, that was done right down here in the streets. I mean, we had our own traffic. We did that in New York, too. In fact there was a picture called Speedy where I had two horses pulling a horse cart down the thing, and we&#x2019;d block off about three blocks. We looked like we had the whole police force there with us. We had our own traffic. It wasn&#x2019;t cheating. Of course, we had a terrible time on that one. One of our own cars got in the way of the horses, and to keep from running into the car, the man had to pull the horse and go down the subway. It didn&#x2019;t hurt the horse, I&#x2019;m happy to say, but we never used him again. He was a little shy after that. But these scenes you saw here were shot with our own traffic and generally with the car in front or in back with the camera. The camera was taking every bit as much of a chance.<br><br><b> The bus was going very much faster than anything else?</b><br><br> We had that bus on a cantilever and the bus tipped itself, so as we&#x2019;d go around the corner we&#x2019;d tip it and over you&#x2019;d go. One thing you had to watch was when you&#x2019;re hanging over the edge&#x2014;which I was&#x2014;that you didn&#x2019;t get your leg caught in between the tip. But we actually did all that stuff. You see, you can&#x2019;t slow your camera down too much because the pedestrians look jerky. In fact in the film they might be jerky, but we didn&#x2019;t want them to look that way.<br><br><b> What speeds did the cameras run at?</b><br><br> I&#x2019;d say they were down around fourteen frames per second, except in some places they might drop it even more. As you were saying, the cameramen in those days had a certain technique and an ability to really keep that crank going. The majority of the audience think we cranked that way, they think we wanted it to go exceptionally fast, and they accept that as the way we made it. Of course, everyone here knows it&#x2019;s not true, but no matter how many times you tell people it was cranked at a much different speed, and that you had to get a much smaller number of frames through the camera than you do now and therefore it&#x2019;s got to go much faster, they don&#x2019;t hear you at all. As much as it&#x2019;s been repeated, I don&#x2019;t think the majority of people have any idea about speed. They don&#x2019;t care, really. I guess if they did care, your picture wouldn&#x2019;t be worth a damn. But the students here would know the difference.<br><br> Now, a picture that I was always afraid of was Safety Last! because I had several scenes in there and they moved pretty fast. But I put it in front of an audience, and it didn&#x2019;t seem to spoil the laughs any. I showed it recently to a group of high school students at Hollywood High and it went as well as it ever did with the crowd I first made it for. So why am I worrying about speed?<br><br><b> Do you think audiences today like the film because of the fast pace?</b><br><br> In some cases they might, and in other places, no. But I think if your comedy is basic enough and they&#x2019;re with you&#x2014;they&#x2019;re laughing with you as well as at you&#x2014;I really don&#x2019;t think it makes too much difference.<br><br> <b> There&#x2019;s a thematic element in The Kid Brother, and I&#x2019;m curious about how it evolved and how you feel about it now.</b><br><br> Basically the theme is &#x201c;brains over brawn.&#x201d; In the film I have two older brothers who are behemoths, and I&#x2019;m the puny little fellow, the boy who thinks and in the end outwits those people who just use their muscles. In a lot of the pictures&#x2014;especially the character comedies&#x2014;we tried to have some kind of hidden theme in there. I guess if you boil it down to &#x201c;be yourself&#x201d; that would be about the shortest you could make it.<br><br> But when it comes to the theme of a picture, we&#x2019;re supposed to be comics, and the audience came to get a chuckle or two. I&#x2019;d go back to another picture we made that Hal Roach and I had a little contention on, and we were both right, in a way. Hal Roach and I made Grandma&#x2019;s Boy and we previewed it, and it kind of lay there, to a certain degree. The film had a fine theme in it, that of &#x201c;mind over matter.&#x201d; The boy&#x2019;s a terrific coward and his grandmother recognizes that. To help him out she gives him a talisman that she says his grandfather had owned. His grandfather had been more cowardly than he, but with this talisman he [the boy] just can&#x2019;t fail, and he becomes a great hero. Of course, at the end he finds out that the talisman was just a handle to her umbrella. He finally realized he&#x2019;d accomplished these things himself. But we didn&#x2019;t put enough comedy in it, so the audience didn&#x2019;t laugh as much as they should have.<br><br><b> Did you ever preview any of your pictures?</b><br><br> I thi...</p><h2>30 Minute Cookbook</h2><p>Discover quick and tasty dishes in Nigel Slater&#39;s The 30-Minute Cook.

So begins A. N. Pirozhkova's moving memoir of her life with Isaac Babel, perhaps the Soviet Union's greatest writer, and one of the literary world's most lively and endearing characters. Pirozhkova was the only female engineer working on Stalin's grand Moscow subway project when she met Babel in 1932 and they spent the next eight years as husband and wife. <i>At His Side</i> is populated with Babel's wide circle of friends - among them Maxim Gorky, Sergey Eisenstein, and Andr� Malraux - and includes some wonderful vignettes, as when Babel accompanies a cantankerous Boris Pasternak on a long train ride to Germany to receive a literary prize. But it is Babel himself, the affable and always witty writer, who is given vivid life on this pages. And then, in 1940, Stalin's secret police arrive at the door to take Babel away, and there begins the long and sorrowful aftermath to the story. After a mock trial, Babel was summarily executed, but his fate was kept from Pirozhkova and for years she was led to believe he was alive - and writing - in a Siberian prison camp. It was not until 1952 that she learned that Babel was dead, but even then the authorities played with the truth, claiming he'd died of a heart attack. It was only after the collapse of the Soviet Union that Pirozhkova learned the true circumstances of Babel's murder.<br><br>"Babel lives in his wife&#x2019;s lucid yet adoring prose. We are with her, at his side"<i>--New York Times Book Review</i><br>"This glimpse into Babel&#x2019;s last few years on earth, written by the person closest to him, will be a treasured possession" <i>--Richard Bernstein<br>The New York Times</i></p><p>A.

In the wake of these books, VanderKam's sane appraisal of the Scrolls' saga and of current Scrolls scholarship, written on a level that is understandable to lay readers and others who are not specialists in the field, is especially welcome. In a balanced fashion, Bible scholar VanderKam addresses the major issues regarding the Scrolls: the circumstances surrounding their discovery and subsequent publication (and nonpublication); the identity of the Qumran group responsible for writing and collecting the documents; and the impact of the Scrolls upon traditional theories and beliefs.

Didion&#39;s ancestors were pioneers, pushing westward to settle the vast lands of California, and with great pride, grit and graft, to turn that desert state into the fifth biggest economy in the world. What kind of people made that magic possible? In this moving and unexpected book, Joan Didion reassesses parts of her life, her work, her history, and America&#39;s. Where I Was From, in Didion&#39;s words, &#34;represents an exploration into my own confusions about the place and the way in which I grew up, misapprehensions and misunderstandings so much a part of who I became that I can still to this day confront them only obliquely. &#34; The book is a haunting narrative of how her own family moved west with the frontier from the birth of her great-great-great-great-great-grandmother in Virginia in 1766 to the death of her mother on the edge of the Pacific in 2001; of how the wagon-train stories of hardship and abandonment and endurance created a culture in which survival would seem the sole virtue.</p><p>"Compelling. . . . A love song to the place where her family has lived for generations, but a love song full of questions and doubts." - Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"An arresting amalgam of memoir and historical timeline. . . . Exquisitely crafted, as subtle as the slow waking from a pleasant dream." - <i>The Baltimore Sun<br><br></i>"One beautiful sentence follows another. . . . This is a book about history, about what we learn from genealogy and history books, novels and old newspapers, and how we square all that with what we see around us. . . . Didion has remained a clearheaded and original writer all her long life." - Malcolm Jones, <i>Newsweek</i><br><br>"Succinct and quite beautiful. . . . Its rewards are many. If anyone needs further confirmation that she is one of the finest essayists currently at work, this book will nail it." - <i>The Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer</i><br><br>"One of the most recognizable - and brilliant - literary styles to emerge in America during the past four decades. . . . [Didion is] a great American writer." - <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br>"Didion has written a brave little book . . . a fine book that must be read with as much care it was written. . . . [Didion is] an implacably honest writer." - Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>"Valediction and elegy alike, <i>Where I Was From</i> is a storm-tossed book.

But her sentences could only be hers." - Michael Gorra, <i>Chicago Tribune<br></i><br>"[A] fascinating, informative, obscure - and yes, moving - little book." - <i>San Jose Mercury News</i><br><br>"A bracing mix of personal and public history." - Benjamin Kunkel, <i>Newsday<br></i><br>"Odd, elliptical and ultimately revealing. . . .

One of the country's most intelligent writers . . .<i> </i>Ms. Didion's prose is like a razor cutting straight to the bone." - <i>New York Sun<br></i><br>"[Didion's] appraisal is cool, her eye is sharp, and her turn of phrase is wicked." - <i>Time</i><br><br>"How odd that bad news can be so much fun to read. Her essays are as sinewy as her novels, written in the same ice-pick/laser-beam prose." - <i>Harper's</i>In this moving and unexpected book, Joan Didion reassesses parts of her life, her work, her history, and ours. <b>Where I Was From</b>, in Didion&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;represents an exploration into my own confusions about the place and the way in which I grew up, confusions as much about America as about California, misapprehensions and misunderstandings so much a part of who I became that I can still to this day confront them only obliquely.&#x201d; The book is a haunting narrative of how her own family moved west with the frontier from the birth of her great-great-great-great-great-grandmother in Virginia in 1766 to the death of her mother on the edge of the Pacific in 2001; of how the wagon-train stories of hardship and abandonment and endurance created a culture in which survival would seem the sole virtue.<br><br>In <b>Where I Was From</b><i>,</i> Didion turns what John Leonard has called &#x201c;her sonar ear, her radar eye&#x201d; onto her own work, as well as that of such California writers as Frank Norris and Jack London and Henry George, to examine how the folly and recklessness in the very grain of the California settlement led to the California we know today&#x2013;a state mortgaged first to the railroad, then to the aerospace industry, and overwhelmingly to the federal government, a dependent colony of those political and corporate owners who fly in for the annual encampment of the <br>Bohemian Club.

From the New York Central&#39;s famous 20th Century Limited to the Eastern Illinois Railroad &#39;s obscure Meadowlark, the plethora of railroads and regions featured is staggering.

Emphasizing classic styles (with a serious soft spot for the ornate details of 18th century European design), McClintock's home exemplifies her take on "romantic decorating." Ostensibly a practical guide to romanticizing one's surroundings, this book is little more than a detailed tour of McLintock's home. McClintock clearly and patiently describes her aesthetic, covering everything from fabric choices and paint colors to doorknobs and switch plates. What she lacks in practicality (the topic of kitchen storage is limited to a handful of paragraphs while table settings receives the multi-page treatment), McClintock generally makes up for in the sheer number of her ideas. Cognizant of the fact that few readers will be able to match her lavish lifestyle, McClintock offers tips on acquiring pieces at antique shops, estate sales and other bargain sources. Though the book falls short as a practical how-to, fans of McClintock's aesthetic will appreciate the opportunity to see her warm and stylishly appointed home. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hilliard III</p><p></p><h2>Oxford First Ancient History (Rebuilding the Past)</h2><p>From the threshold of history and the early civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China to the glories of Rome and Greece and the fall of the Roman Empire--here's a fascinating tour into the past. Author Roy Burrell has combined <em>The Romans</em> and <em>The Greeks</em> into one beautifully illustrated volume and added lots of new information about other early civilizations. Factual essays are interspersed with "interviews" with characters from the ancient world to make history an exciting time full of real and interesting people. Readers gain an understanding of the development of early civilizations and the techniques historians and archeologists use to explore and interpret events of the past. This is powerful history that brings the ancient world to life for readers ages 11-15.</p><p><br>The late <strong>Roy Burrell</strong> was the author of <em>The Greeks</em> and <em>The Romans</em> and many other historical books for children.<br><strong>Peter Connolly</strong> is an honorary research fellow of the Institute of Archaeology in London. He is the author and illustrator of <em>The Roman Army,</em> <em>Pompeii,</em> <em>Greece and Rome at War,</em> and <em>The Legend of Odysseus.</em><br>Gr. 4-7. Beginning with prehistory, this book surveys ancient civilizations, primarily in the Mediterranean region. Although sections of several pages cover the ancient Egyptians, Sumerians, Persians, and Britons, and two-page sections survey the Phoenicians, Chinese, Assyrians, and others, most of the book presents the cultures of the Greeks and the Romans. Every page includes at least one full-color illustration, a map, a cutaway drawing, a painting re-creating the times, or a photograph of a wall painting, sculpture, artifact, site, or explorer. Not only is the format inviting, but the text is also quite readable. Besides standard presentations of facts, the author conducts imaginary interviews with such characters as a Babylonian soldier discussing justice under Hammurabi, a worker for Sir Arthur Evans talking about the excavations at Knossos, and a Greek mask maker describing the theater. English in origin, the book may occasionally confuse readers with its Briticisms, but this is still a lively, helpful resource. One warning: considering the price, the binding could be (should be) stronger. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>The Power of Prayer and Fasting: 10 Secrets of Spiritual Strength</h2><p>The spiritual discipline of prayer and fasting is not a gimmick or a spiritual fad.

Yet even with this greater understanding of the human mind, why we do what we do can sometimes seem like a mystery. People are often left with unsettling questions about their own (or others') behavior.</p> <p>We ask ourselves, Why did I make a spectacle of myself? Why am I so stressed? Why am I constantly so negative?</p><p>In his years as a clinician, Dr. Ted George has been struck by how much easier it is for people to say they have a physical illness than it is to admit they feel out of control with an emotion&#x2014;be it anger, fear, or depression. With a physical issue, you have the source of the problem in concrete terms, such as in a lab report, but with an emotional issue, it can be much harder to define what's gone wrong. <em>Untangling the Mind</em> helps make sense of what's happening&#x2014;and why. With knowledge of how the brain translates sensory signals into emotions, you will increase your understanding of your own&#x2014;and others'&#x2014;behaviors. As you learn about your psychological and neurological makeup, you will begin to see new possibilities for optimism, motivation, and well-being. </p><p>We <em>can</em> control our behavior and our feelings, no matter how much they may have ruled us in the past, and Dr. George helps us know how. Once you understand the deeply rooted instincts that activate your emotions, you can live more peacefully, behave in ways that are more in keeping with the person you'd like to be, and enjoy your life more fully. And you'll be better able to remain unaffected by the drama of other people's emotional storms.</p></p><p><p>Ted George, M.D., board-certified in psychiatry and internal medicine, is an associate clinical director at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and a clinical professor of psychiatry at George Washington University School of Medicine.

Even more amazing, after it's unearthed the artifact releases a powerful signal aimed at Saturn. What sort of alarm has been triggered?

Tuesdays and Wednesdays after school we practiced in the music room, but on Fridays Mr. Chervenick led us outside in our down jackets and tasseled Steeler hats and shitkicker boots and across the footbridge that spanned the interstate to the middle school soccer field, where, like the football team itself, we ran square-outs and curls and a maneuver Mr. Chervenick called an oblique, with which, for the finale of every halftime show, we described&#x2014;all 122 of us&#x2014;a whirling funnel approximating our school&#x2019;s nickname, the Golden Tornadoes. We never got it quite right, though every Friday Mr. Chervenick tried to inspire us, scampering across the frost-slicked grass in his chocolate leather coat and kid gloves and cordovans to herd us into formation until&#x2014;in utter disgust&#x2014;instead of steering a wayward oboe back on course he would simply arrest him or her by the shoulders so the entire block of winds had to stop, and then the brass and the drums, and we would have to start all over again.<br>Late one Friday in mid-December we were working on the tornado.

An inch or so had fallen during the day and it was impossible to see the lines. &#x201c;Wrong, wrong, wrong!&#x201d; Mr. Chervenick shouted. When the girl pulling the xylophone slipped and twisted her ankle, he blew his whistle three times, which meant we were to line up for a final chastising pep talk before we could leave. He climbed the three steps of his little wheeled podium and let us stand in silence for a minute so we would realize how disappointed he was. Snow piled up in our hair. Beyond the sea of flakes drifting through the high lights came the ringing drone of a tractor-trailer&#x2019;s chains on the interstate. In the valley, muffled by a ceiling of clouds, lay the burning grid of Butler, the black river, the busy mills.<br>&#x201c;We have all worked very hard this year,&#x201d; he said, and paused, breathing steam, as if speaking to a stadium, waiting for his words to circle. Beside me Warren Hardesty muttered something&#x2014;a joke, a rejoinder&#x2014;and then we heard what I immediately identified (from my own .22, my father&#x2019;s Mossberg, the nightly news from Vietnam) as gunshots. A clump of them. They crackled like fireworks, echoed over the bare trees on the other side of the highway. They were close. The band turned to them in unison, something Mr. Chervenick could never get us to do.<br>It had just turned deer season, and we all knew the power company had a clearcut through there behind the water tower, as well as the rights to the few overgrown fields carved out of the woods, but all of us with guns knew the land was posted, too close to the road and the school. And the time wasn&#x2019;t right for hunting, the light was gone. We looked to each other as if to confirm our surprise.<br>Mr. Chervenick seemed to understand too, though he was not the hunting type. He praised our dedication, excused us and, instead of leading us back over the footbridge, headed across the empty parking lot for the lit doors of the middle school and stood there rapping on the glass until the janitor let him in.<br>What we had heard was someone being murdered, someone most of us knew, if dimly. Her name was Annie Marchand, and I knew her first&#x2014;years before this&#x2014;merely as Annie the babysitter. Her name at that time was Annie Van Dorn. She lived, then, with her parents, the next house down the road from us. We were not strictly neighbors; between our new hi-ranch and their boxy Greek Revival stretched a mile-wide field Mr. Van Dorn leased to an old farmer named Carlsen. Yet whenever my mother and father decided to escape for dinner out or to a movie, Mr. Van Dorn&#x2019;s truck would pull up at the bottom of our drive and out would pop Annie with her purse and her schoolbooks, ready to whip me at Candyland and train my sister Astrid to draw on eyeliner.<br>I suspect that at first Astrid was more in love with her than I was. At thirteen Annie was taller than our mother, and strikingly thin. Her red hair came to her waist; her fingers were covered with rings from admirers. She smelled of the Van Dorns&#x2019; oil furnace and Secret deodorant and Juicy Fruit gum, and she made pizza and sang &#x201c;Ruby Tuesday&#x201d; and, for me, &#x201c;Mr. Big Stuff.&#x201d; Our daydreams, I admit, included her becoming our mother. Once we had an evening-long argument with her over the word &#x201c;milk,&#x201d; which we&#x2014;like most Western Pennsylvanians&#x2014;pronounced &#x201c;melk,&#x201d; but it did nothing to mediate our crush on her. This went on for years, like a grand affair. She left us only when my sister was old enough to watch me, and by then Annie was out of school and working, and sometimes my mother could not get her for Fridays anyway. We&#x2019;d see her driving by in her brother Raymond&#x2019;s Maverick or riding behind her boyfriend on his Honda, but rarely. For a few years she became&#x2014;by her proximity and absence&#x2014;distant and mysterious. My bedroom faced the field, and at night I studied the yellow eyes of her house and pictured her in her darkened room looking back at me.<br>Since then she had moved out like her brothers and married and had a girl of her own, but things had not gone well for her. That spring, she and her husband had separated. Mrs. Van Dorn, now widowed, lived alone in the family house. My mother looked in on her every day after work, and often that fall Annie was there, in the kitchen, the two of them commiserating bitterly over coffee. The worst, they must have figured, had already happened.<br>According to my mother, Mrs. Van Dorn wanted Annie to move back in with her. Annie and her daughter were living alone above town by the high school. Her house was the only one on Turkey Hill Road, a wooded cul-de-sac that ended at the base of the county water tower. The road had once crossed Old Route 2 but when they laid the interstate the government bought up all the houses and blocked it off on both sides. Beyond a caution-striped guardrail the cracked blacktop wandered off into scrub. The other, unluckier houses were still back there, overgrown, shingles mossy; we used to party in them. Mrs. Van Dorn was worried about Annie&#x2019;s safety, but she and Annie&#x2014;again, according to my mother&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t get along well enough to live together, and Annie stayed where she was.<br>At the hearing her nearest neighbor, Clare Hardesty, said she&#x2019;d heard the shots and gone to her window. The road was empty, the spotlit water tower half lost in the snow. Annie&#x2019;s lights were on; a colored string blinked around a tree. Clare didn&#x2019;t see any cars that didn&#x2019;t belong, meaning, she explained, the boyfriend&#x2019;s. The two had recently broken up; she would have noticed. When she called, no one answered, so she put on her boots and a wrap and walked down the road. The front door was open, the light spilling out onto the snow. (Here she was asked about footprints, a single broken pane, glass on the bathroom carpet; she didn&#x2019;t know, she didn&#x2019;t know.) Though the house was empty, something had happened inside. She tried the phone, then ran back to her place to call the state police.<br>And do you remember noticing, the transcript reads, if the back door was open at this time?<br>I don&#x2019;t remember, Clare Hardesty answers.<br>I know&#x2014;and everyone I grew up with knows&#x2014;that the back door was open and that a pair of tracks led across the backyard and into the woods. We followed them at first in our imaginations, those snowy nights alone in bed (their breath, her bare feet sinking in), and then when the brave had made their pilgrimage, at lunch we hauled on our boots and crossed the interstate and slid down the hill to the spot we as a whole had chosen, just to one side of the board bridge over the spillway of Marsden&#x2019;s Pond. Both the pond and the brook were iced over; only the spillway made noise. The more romantic of the tough girls had placed roses in a vase made of snow, every day a fresh one among the dead. Someone had tramped out a cross, which by January was neatly lined with beer cans. To one side sat a pile of lipsticked cigarette butts and burnt matches like an offering. We stood there, alone or in groups, looking back over the tangle of bare trees beyond which rose the water tower, and below it, invisible, her house. We passed a joint or bowl around and talked about how she was still there in the trees and the creek because the soul never dies. Someone always had gum, and I remember chewing and feeling my jaw harden and thinking that it was true, that I could feel Annie there. But at other times there was nothing, just munchies and a giddiness I would later be ashamed of.<br>March, cutting class, Warren Hardesty and I walked from the spot all the way to the edge of her backyard, retracing her last steps. It was farther than we thought, and we had to stop to stoke up a roach I&#x2019;d saved. Warren had some blackberry brandy in a plastic Girl Scout canteen. It was Monday, around third period. The house was for sale but no one was going to buy it. The paint was peeling, the screenporch still full of her junk&#x2014;lawnchairs, rabbit cages, deflated balls. Warren dared me to cross the lawn and just touch the house.<br>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Shit, I live right up the road.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; I said.<br>We did it together, leaving two sets of bootprints in the perfect snow. We each placed a gloved hand on the porch door. Through a casement window I could see a corner of a rug, and a chair, and light coming through the blue curtains of the front.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go inside,&#x201d; Warren said.<br>&#x201c;Fuck you,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Pussy,&#x201d; he said, as if there were someone else there judging us.<br>I dropped my glove to the door handle.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right behind you,&#x201d; Wa...</p><h2>ECOLOGY AS POLITICS</h2><p>Andre Gorz, to my mind the greatest of modern French social thinkers, dares to venture where no one really has before. Fighters for democratic socialism and an ecological society have each recognized the handwriting on the wall: modern society cannot continue on its present path. Neither group, however, has even begun to recognize the other&#39;s value, beyond being little more than a tactical means towards achieving their own ends. Gorz, in this exciting and penetrating gem of a book, addresses precisely this question, and offers a connection between the political and the ecological.In an age of crisis the realist becomes visionary and the visionary the rational architect of the future. Andre Gorz is just that. The present decade will be a debacle for progressive change unless our creative efforts move towards linking our concerns with the quality of life to those of economic and political structure. Andre Gorz, as this little volume bears witness, has taken up where Herbert Marcuse left off. &#39;The only things worthy of each,&#39; Gorz says, &#39;are those which are good for all.&#39; This book is worthy indeed of each.</p><p>Andre Gorz was one of Europe&#39;s leading thinkers on politics. He is the author of several books including Ecology as Politics and Paths to Paradise.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Simon &amp; Schuster Children's Guide to Insects and Spiders</h2><p>A detailed introduction to spiders and insects contains information about every major group of arachnids and insects, hundreds of thought-provoking facts, and full-color pictures and photographs.</p><p>Grade 4-6. This profusely illustrated introduction surveys over 100 assorted insects and arachnids. A preface describes the animals' general characteristics, some special anatomical features, and the major differences between the two classes. The bulk of the material is organized into eight chapters, each of which concentrates on a group of creatures that share certain characteristics. For instance, one chapter examines insect predators such as mantids and dragonflies, while another looks at members of the order Lepidoptera. Each chapter begins with a general discussion of the subject and a greatly enlarged, full-color photo of a representative species. An illustrated "catalog" of about a dozen different invertebrates follows. The text is concise and well organized, but some information is unclear. For example, in referring to the mating behavior of the crab spider, the text reads, "This spider...does not make webs, but the smaller males sometimes use their silk to tie the females down before mating." Without some prior knowledge of spider behavior, the sentence is unclear?females sometimes mistake the smaller males as prey, and that is the purpose of their binding the females. Laurence Mound's Insect (Knopf, 1990) offers similar information; however, Johnson's book is more tightly organized and it covers a number of species not included elsewhere. More detailed information on a greater number of spiders is available in Jennifer Dewey's Spiders Near and Far (Dutton, 1993). Despite the book's aforementioned minor flaws, this will be a useful guide to the insect world.?Karey Wehner, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3^-5. This large-format book identifies families of insects in short paragraphs of text accompanied by large-scale, full-color paintings and photographs. Well-labeled diagrams identify the body types and parts common to many insects and spiders. Within each large category (flies, beetles, etc.), a double-page spread focuses on one member of the group, such as the honeybee or dragonfly, offering a closer look at its stages of development, habits, and special characteristics. Crisp and well-designed, this is an inviting visual introduction to insects and arachnids. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Calligraphy workstation (Workstations)</h2><p>This unique, self-contained kit instructs artists in every aspect of this gorgeous artform including technique, spacing, italics, flourishes, numbers, and punctuation, and outlines a variety of projects to test their newly attained skills.

We witness the gradual breakdown of a genius ceaselessly compelled to correct and refine his perceptions until the only logical conclusion of the negation of his own soul.</p><p>Thomas Bernhard was born in Holland in 1931 but grew up in Austria. His interest in music and theatre led him to study at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. He has written a quantity of poetry, several novels, short stories and plays and three volumes of autobiography. He died in 1989.Hoeller's Garret<br><br>After a mild pulmonary infection, tended too little and too late, had suddenly turned into a severe pneumonia that took its toll of my entire body and laid me up for at least three months at nearby Wels, which has a hospital renowned in the field of so-called internal medicine, I accepted an invitation from Hoeller, a so-called taxidermist in the Aurach valley, not for the end of October, as the doctors urged, but for early in October, as I insisted, and then went on my own so-called responsibility straight to the Aurach valley and to Hoeller's house, without even a detour to visit my parents in Stocket, straight into the so-called Hoeller garret, to begin sifting and perhaps even arranging the literary remains of my friend, who was also a friend of the taxidermist Hoeller, Roithamer, after Roithamer's suicide, I went to work sifting and sorting the papers he had willed to me, consisting of thousands of slips covered with Roithamer's handwriting plus a bulky manuscript entitled "About Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, with special attention to the Cone." The atmosphere in Hoeller's house was still heavy, most of all with the circumstances of Roithamer's suicide, and seemed from the moment of my arrival favorable to my plan of working on Roithamer's papers there, specifically in Hoeller's garret, sifting and sorting Roithamer's papers and even, as I suddenly decided, simultaneously writing my own account of my work on these papers, as I have here begun to do, aided by having been able to move straight into Hoeller's garret without any reservations on Hoeller's part, even though the house had other suitable accommodations, I deliberately moved into that four-by-five-meter garret Roithamer was always so fond of, which was so ideal, especially in his last years, for his purposes, where I could stay as long as I liked, it was all the same to Hoeller, in this house built by the headstrong Hoeller in defiance of every rule of reason and architecture right here in the Aurach gorge, in the garret which Hoeller had designed and built as if for Roithamer's purposes, where Roithamer, after sixteen years in England with me, had spent the final years of his life almost continuously, and even prior to that he had found it convenient to spend at least his nights in the garret, especially while he was building the Cone for his sister in the Kobemausser forest, all the time the Cone was under construction he no longer slept at home in Altensam but always and only in Hoeller's garret, it was simply in every respect the ideal place for him during those last years when he, Roithamer, never went straight home to Altensam from England, but instead went every time to Hoeller's garret, to fortify himself in its simplicity (Hoeller house) for the complexity ahead (Cone), it would not do to go straight to Altensam from England, where each of us, working separately in his own scientific field, had been living in Cambridge all those years, he had to go straight to Hoeller's garret, if he did not follow this rule which had become a cherished habit, the visit to Altensam was a disaster from the start, so he simply could not let himself go directly from England to Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, whenever he had not made the detour via Hoeller's house, to save time, as he himself admitted, it had been a mistake, so he no longer made the experiment of going to Altensam without first stopping at Hoeller's house, in those last years, he never again went home without first visiting Hoeller and Hoeller's family and Hoeller's house, without first moving into Hoeller's garret, to devote himself for two or three days to such reading as he could do only in Hoeller's garret, of subject matter that was not harmful but helpful to him, books and articles he could read neither in Altensam nor in England, and to thinking and writing what he found possible to think and write neither in England nor in Altensam, here I discovered Hegel, he always said, over and over again, it was here that I really delved into Schopenhauer for the first time, here that I could read, for the first time, Goethe's Elective Affinities and The Sentimental Journey, without distraction and with a clear head, it was here, in Hoeller's garret, that I suddenly gained access to ideas to which my mind had been sealed for decades before I came to this garret, access, he wrote, to the most essential ideas, the most important for me, the most necessary to my life, here in Hoeller's garret, he wrote, everything became possible for me, everything that had always been impossible for me outside Hoeller's garret, such as letting myself be guided by my intellectual inclinations and to develop my natural aptitudes accordingly, and to get on with my work, everywhere else I had always been hindered in developing my aptitudes but in Hoeller's garret I could always develop them most consistently, here everything was congenial to my way of thinking, here .1 could always indulge myself in exploring all my intellectual possibilities, here in Hoeller's garret my head, my mind, my whole constitution were suddenly relieved from all the outside world's oppression, the most incredible things were suddenly no longer incredible, the most impossible (thinking!) no longer impossible. It was in Hoeller's garret that he found the conditions necessary and most favorable to thought, for getting the mechanism of his thought going in the most natural, most undistracted way, all he had to do was to come to Hoeller's garret from wherever he might be, and the mechanism worked. Whenever I was in England, he wrote, no matter how I felt, I was always thinking, if only I could be in Hoener's garret now, always when he had reached a dead end in his thinking and in his feelings, if only I could be in Hoeller's garret now, but on the other hand he realized that settling for good in Hoener's garret was not synonymous with always being able to think freely and without distraction, and that, if he could stay forever in Hoeller's garret, it would mean nothing less than his own total destruction, if I stay in Hoener's garret longer than need be, he wrote, I'll be done for in no time at all, that's the end of me, he thought, which is why he had always stayed in Hoeller's garret for only a definite period of time, how long exactly he could never foresee, but it had to be strictly limited, he must have considered a stay of fourteen to fifteen days in the Hoeller garret ideal, as his notes imply, always just fourteen or fifteen days, every time, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day, according to Hoeller, Roithamer always packed up in a flash and went off to Altensam, though he did not necessarily stay in Altensam for any length of time very often, but only for the shortest possible time, as little time as he could manage, the absolute, inescapable minimum, no more, he had even been known to take up residence in Hoeller's house with every intention of going on to Altensam after fourteen days or so, but instead of going on to Altensam where he was expected, where his arrival had already been announced, after fourteen or fifteen days, he went from Hoeller's place in the Aurach gorge straight back to England, because his stay at Hoeller's place, in the Hoeller ambience, had not only given him enough, but had actually advanced his thinking so much that he did not need to stop at Altensam but could go straight back to England, specifically Cambridge, where he was always both studying and teaching simultaneously and, as he always kept saying, he never exactly knew at any particular moment whether he was studying or teaching because, as he said, when I was teaching, I was in fact basically studying, and when I was studying, I was basically teaching. Actually I too found the atmosphere in Hoeller's house ideal, I immediately made myself at home in the garret which had been Roithamer's garret and will always remain Roithamer's garret, from the very start I had always intended to take notes on my work with Roithamer's papers and on the entire process involved, and I soon understood how perfect for Roithamer's purposes Hoeller's garret was, how he had settled into Hoeller's garret with its view to westward, pitch-dark it was over the raging Aurach, and to northward, also pitch dark, the water steadily and always noisily slapping and crashing against the wet, glistening rock-face, "rehearsing for AItensam in Hoeller's house" as he called those stays in Hoeller's house, specifically Hoeller's garret, stays that quickly succeeded one another in those last years, especially the last three years, when he went five or six times, for four or five months at a time, from England to Altensam, but actually only to Hoeller's garret, obviously attracted to it by Hoeller's work, those meticulous preservations of animals, and in general by all the curious conditions of the place, so intimately bound up with the play of light in the Aurach valley, where every day ran its course simply enough, but nature was always making itself so powerfully felt, a nature mostly in pain, and all the people there, Hoeller's parents and in-laws and his wife and his still school-age children, for whom everything turned on what game had been shot and gutted, what wildfowl shot and gutted, and all the related chores, all the circumstances of life were bound up with their natural surroundings, it became clear to me that Roithamer had found here in the Aurach gorge as he had nowhere else the inspiration for pressing on with his main task, the building of the Cone, that edifice as a work of art, which he had designed for his sister in three years of incessant mental concentration and which he had built in the following three years with the greatest effort, with what he called almost inhuman energy, built it in the very center of the Kobernausser forest. It was in Hoeller's garret, where I had now moved with Roithamer's papers, most of them relating to the building of the Cone, and I regard my work on Roithamer's papers as the ideal occupational therapy for myself after my long illness and also feel it is ideal, it was here that Roithamer had conceived the idea of the Cone and drawn up the basic plans for it, and the fact that even now, some months after Roithamer's death and half a year after his sister's death, his sister for whom he had built the Cone which is already abandoned to natural decay, Hoeller's garret still contains all the plans, all the books and articles, most of them never used but all of them collected by Roithamer in his last years with a view to building the Cone, all those books and articles in every possible language, including languages unknown to him but translated for him by his brother Johann who spoke many languages and in fact had a gift for languages like no other man I ever knew, the translations were also here in Hoener's garret, and I could see at once that there had to be hundreds of them, stacks of translations from Spanish and Portuguese, as I noticed when I entered the garret, hundreds if not thousands of laborious decipherments of probably important considerations for the construction and completion of the Cone by experts unknown to me but probably familiar to him, he hated the word architect, or architecture, he never said architect, or architecture, and when I or someone else said architect, or architecture, he instantly countered by saying that he could not stand hearing the word architect, or architecture, that these two words were nothing but malformations, verbal monstrosities which no thinking man would stoop to, and I never used the words architect, or architecture, in his presence, nor have I used them since, even Hoeller got accustomed to avoiding the words architect or architecture, like Roithamer we resorted to words such as master builder or building or the art of building; that the word B U I L D is one of the most beautiful in the language, we knew ever since Roithamer had spoken about it, in that same garret where I have now installed myself, one dismal rainy evening when we again, as so often, dreaded the onset of another one of those torrential floods that come tearing down the gorge to devastate the whole area sometimes, though this one receded unexpectedly, those floods in the Aurach gorge would do the most extensive damage but they always spared Hoener's house, all up and down the Aurach they did the most extensive damage but Hoener's house, which was built right into the cleft, was spared always, because Hoeller had known exactly what he was doing, everyone was amazed to see the whole Aurach valley buried in mud, ravaged and destroyed while Hoeller's house alone stood unscathed, incredibly, it was on this dismal rainy evening, with all of us living in fear of another such flood about to bemire and ravage everything in its path, though this time it did not happen, when Roithamer revealed to us the beauty of the word building and the beauty of the word build and the beauty of the phrase builder's masterwork. From time to time he would pick out a word like that, a word that had suddenly become luminous with meaning for him, pick out one word from among all those others, any word at all, and elucidate it to anyone, but usually to those of us who often came in the evening to Hoeller's house and always regularly on those weekends when Roithamer returned from England. Once, as I recall, he spent a whole night analyzing for us the word circumstance, the word condition, and the word consistent. It was touching to find all of Roithamer's books and articles and plans and his writing utensils and thinking aids still right there in Hoeller's garret, just as he had left them. Hoeller's garret was where all the ideas and designs for building the Cone had come into being, here all the ideas had originated, all the plans were sketched, all the necessary decisions for building the Cone had been made here, it was from here Roithamer had directed everything.</p><h2>The Burgess Bird Book for Children (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Through the eyes of Peter Rabbit we become acquainted with a variety of birds as they return to Peter&#39;s neighborhood in the spring.

With sixteen novels over four decades -- from &#39;The Drowned World&#39; in 1962 to his highly acclaimed &#39;Super-Cannes&#39; in 2000 -- J.G. Ballard is firmly established as one of Britain&#39;s most highly regarded and original novelists. For all that time he has also written short stories; in fact, many people consider that he is at his best in the short-story format. These stories have appeared in magazines such as &#39;New Worlds&#39;, &#39;Amazing Stories&#39; and &#39;Interzone&#39;, and in several separate collections, including &#39;The Voices of Time&#39;, &#39;The Terminal Beach&#39;, &#39;The Day of Forever&#39;, &#39;The Venus Hunters,&#39; &#39;The Disaster Area&#39;, &#39;Vermilion Sands&#39;, &#39;Low-Flying Aircraft&#39;, &#39;Myths of the Near Future&#39; and &#39;War Fever&#39;. Now, for the first time, all of J.G. Ballard&#39;s published stories -- including four stories that have not previously appeared in a collection -- have been gathered together in one volume and set out in the order in which they were originally published, providing an unprecedented opportunity to review the career of one of Britain&#39;s greatest writers.</p><p>J.G. Ballard was born in 1930 in Shanghai, where his father was a businessman. After internment in a civilian prison camp, he and his family returned to England in 1946. His 1984 bestseller Empire of the Sun won the Guardian Fiction Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It was later filmed by Steven Spielberg. His controversial novel Crash has recently been made into an equally controversial film by David Cronenberg.&#39;The most important contemporary British writer.&#39; Will Self, Independent &#39;He has had from the start an extraordinary descriptive gift, an eye for the mood and code of the visual environment that is like Poe&#39;s, but steadier. He remains most effective in the tight capsule of the short story.&#39; Richard Holmes, The Times &#39;Ballard is the most modern of writers; his art engages with the artefacts and obsessions of the second half of the century in a manner and with an intensity umatched by any other writer.&#39; William Boyd, Daily Telegraph &#39;J.G. Ballard is a magician of the contemporary scene and a literary saboteur. Ballard&#39;s fantastical landscapes are among the most haunting in English literature.

Thank you Gary for writing it. -- <i>Terry Hickey, Founder, Halton/Peel Pet Loss Support Group</i><br><br>I read both of Gary's books and experienced great joy and blessing. -- <i>Dr. Jack Van Impe, TV Evangelist letter of September 2001</i><br><br>WINNER OF FAITHWRITER'S.COM SEAL OF APPROVAL FOR "OUTSTANDING READ". <p>Losing a pet is a very difficult experience for most pet owners. The isolation one feels when dealing with this specific kind of grief can be overwhelming at times. After all, most people seem to think, 'it was only an animal.' Gary Kurz, author of Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates, wants you to know you are not alone. Not only are there others who understand your intense feelings of loss, but there is also reason for great hope. </p><p>In the introduction to his book, Mr. Kurz explains that it was the loss of his beloved Chihuahua, Pebbles, that led him to research the concept of animal afterlife. In the wake of Pebbles' death, a friend reacted to Kurz's grief with the cold response of someone who has clearly never shared a close relationship with an animal. Her sarcastic remark about "doggy heaven" led Kurz to turn to the Bible for comfort and understanding of what had become of his cherished Pebbles-and we should all be glad he did. </p><p>The result is a book offering great comfort and peace to anyone, young or old, who has ever lost a pet. No, there isn't a doggy heaven. In fact, there is only one Heaven and it is a place where we will all live together. All of us humans and our lost, but not forgotten, pets. </p><p>Mr. Kurz leads the reader through a convincing analysis of the spiritual state of animals. Do they have a soul? Yes. Are they loved by their Creator? Yes, indeed. Mr. Kurz explores several other topics in the book that I found quite thought-provoking. In one section he proposes that animals will have the ability to speak in the afterlife. Initially, even I (a diehard animal lover myself) reacted with skepticism to this concept. But, once I read what the author had to say on the subject, it seemed a natural, logical assumption. I looked at my dog and half-expected her to open her mouth and talk to me. </p><p>Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates is an incredibly well researched book offering true and lasting peace for individuals coping with pet loss. The author's concern for his readers is made evident throughout the book. He wants you to know you are not alone and that the Word of God offers you hope in your grief and salvation through Jesus Christ. I would recommend it to all animal lovers. -- <i>Terry Wilson, Faith Writer's Book Reviewer, February 2007</i><br><br>I read this fabulous book.

They pay mental assent to the concept, but their hearts are untouched.</p> <p>In the author's words, "God's grace is amazing, abundant, free, and available. So why is spiritual famine an epidemic both inside and outside the church? Because although we've come to Christ by recognizing grace, few of us have carried it along as essential equipment on the Christian path. . . . God never promised a pain-free life, but he did promise that his grace is all we need in our search for peace and fulfillment."</p> <p><em>Breathing Grace</em> is a unique look at a topic that stands at the very core of the Christian faith. Dr. Harry Kraus, best-selling author and practicing surgeon, reveals the gospel of grace through a series of medical metaphors, predominantly the physiology of our need for and utilization of oxygen. The clinical flavor of the book brings to life a subject that many Christians have failed to grasp and incorporate into their daily lives, illustrating our need, God's provision, and the moment-by-moment inflow and exhalation of grace to a starving world.</p> <p><em>Breathing Grace</em> includes study questions for group and individual use.</p></p><p><p><strong>Harry Kraus, M.D.</strong>, is a practicing general surgeon and the author of eight novels, including the best-selling <em>Could I Have This Dance?</em> and <em>The Chairman</em>. He received his M.D. degree from Medical College of Virginia, completed his surgical internship and residency at University of Kentucky, and formerly practiced in Virginia. Dr. Kraus is currently serving with Africa Inland Mission as a missionary surgeon at Kijabe Hospital in Kenya, where he lives with his wife and three sons. Visit his website at www.cuttingedgefiction.com.</p><p>"My friend Harry Kraus is an accomplished surgeon and novelist.

Harry's heart for God and for people spills over on each page."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Randy Alcorn</strong><strong>,</strong> Founder and Director, Eternal Perspective Ministries; author, <em>Heaven </em>and<em> Happiness</em></p><p>"There is no shortage of books on divine grace, but this one is different. Kraus has resorted to a medical metaphor, which he uses especially well in an era when the public is obsessed with health and medicine. But the real lack is spiritual maintenance, which in this presentation is laid out in an interesting and exciting fashion. Thrilling case histories, both medical and spiritual, abound. The human body can go three weeks without food, three days without water, three minutes without oxygen, but spiritual need requires minute by minute dosing, and grace is the remedy. This is not merely a 'how to' book but conveys a simple and satisfying way of life."<br>&#x2014;<strong>C. Everett Koop</strong>, former Sugeron General of the United States; former Editor-in-Chief, <em>Journal of Pediatric Surgery</em></p><p>"With a physician's skill, my favorite Christian fiction writer dissects the truths of grace with compelling medical analogies. Breathing Grace is soul surgery that will transform your life as it probes the core of your relationship with God."<br>&#x2014;<strong>David Stevens</strong><strong>,</strong> CEO, Christian Medical and Dental Associations</p><p>"Kraus combines creative imagination, professional and clinical perspectives, and cross-cultural insights from his work in Africa with the Scriptures as the word of grace and does so out of his own genuine commitment to Christ. The uniting thread that runs through the book is the emphasis that knowing Jesus in grace makes a radical difference in the way we live and relate to others. Through this work the reader will be enriched in spirit and in faith."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Myron S.

Despite the audacity of his writing, he has won virtually every national literary prize, including China&#x2019;s Annual Writer&#x2019;s Prize, its most prestigious award. He is the author of<em> The Garlic Ballads</em>, <em>The Republic of Wine</em>; <em>Shifu, You&#x2019;ll Do Anything for a Laugh</em>; <em>Big Breasts and Wide Hips</em>, and <em>Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out</em>, all published by Arcade, as well as <em>Red Sorghum </em>and <em>Pow!</em>. Mo Yan and his family live in Beijing.<p> Reviewed by Steven Moore</p><p></p><p>To encompass the ideological insanity of Mao Zedong's policies and the unimaginable horrors he inflicted on the Chinese people requires a boldly unconventional style. That need has been filled by this wild man of Chinese fiction: Mo Yan -- a pseudonymic phrase meaning "Don't speak." Over the last 20 years, Mo Yan has been writing brutally vibrant stories about rural life in China that flout official Party ideology and celebrate individualism over conformity. (How he has escaped imprisonment -- or worse -- I don't know.) He also flouts literary conformity, spiking his earthy realism with fantasy, hallucination and metafiction. </p><p>His previous novel, the voluptuously titled Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips, revealed the horrors of Chinese life during the first half of the 20th century; his new one, the exuberantly imaginative Life And Death Are Wearing Me Out, covers the second, even worse half. The story, which revives the Buddhist notion of reincarnation, begins on Jan. 1, 1950, in hell. Lord Yama, king of the underworld, is examining a benevolent landowner named Ximen Nao, who was brutally executed two years earlier (like thousands of landowners) so that his land could be redistributed to peasants. Frustrated that Ximen will not admit any guilt, Yama punishes him by sending him back to his village in the form of a donkey.</p><p></p><p>Ximen remains in that form for the next 10 years, witnessing the Land Reform Movement and the disastrous Great Leap Forward that killed tens of millions of people (and an unrecorded number of Chinese animals -- the novel reminds us this Earth belongs to them, too). The donkey is angry at first when he learns his trusted farmhand Lan Lian has married Ximen's concubine, but he's mollified as Lan carries on as a fiercely independent farmer, the last holdout in collectivized China. The donkey is killed during the great famine, accompanied by appropriate animal imagery: "Then the famine came," Mo Yan writes, "turning the people into wild animals, cruel and unfeeling. After eating all the bark from trees and the edible grass, a gang of them charged into the Ximen estate compound like a pack of starving wolves." Ximen is reincarnated next as an ox, then a pig, a dog, a monkey and finally -- on New Year's Eve 2000 -- as a child. On his fifth birthday, the child and elderly Lan Lian get together and, taking turns, narrate the novel we've just read.</p><p></p><p>It's a grimly entertaining overview of recent Chinese history. As a "wise German shepherd" summarizes it, "People in the 1950s were innocent, in the 1960s they were fanatics, in the 1970s they were afraid of their own shadows, in the 1980s they carefully weighed people's words and actions, and in the 1990s they were simply evil." But brave individuals emerge as the true heroes; aside from the animal reincarnations of Ximen Nao, these include Lan Lian for refusing to give in to communal pressure, and his son Lan Jiefang, who defies convention by abandoning his legal wife (from an arranged marriage) for a woman he loves, ruining himself in the process. The most colorful individual is the novelist himself, who pops in and out of the story, usually to the annoyance of the other characters.</p><p>But I don't want to leave the impression that this is a gimmicky book that makes light of recent Chinese history. Born in 1955, Mo Yan endured the worst of it -- he, too, was so poor that he ate tree bark -- and there are descriptions that will shock readers into realizing this is no literary game. Indeed, reality keeps outrunning the author's satire. Near the end of the novel, a born-again capitalist devises a Cultural Revolution theme park, as tasteless as a Nazi theme park in Poland. And yet there are now Cultural Revolution-themed caf�s in China, favored by urban hipsters with an almost American ignorance of history. </p><p>Mo Yan offers insights into communist ideology and predatory capitalism that we ignore at our peril. This "lumbering animal of a story," as he calls it, combines the appeal of a family saga set against tumultuous events with the technical bravura of innovative fiction.

Much modern art disdains beauty, and many philosophers deeply suspect that beauty merely paints over or distracts us from horrors. Intellectuals consigned the passions of beauty to the margins, replacing them with the anemic and rarefied alternative, "aesthetic pleasure." In <i>Only a Promise of Happiness</i>, Alexander Nehamas reclaims beauty from its critics. He seeks to restore its place in art, to reestablish the connections among art, beauty, and desire, and to show that the values of art, independently of their moral worth, are equally crucial to the rest of life.</p><br><p> Nehamas makes his case with characteristic grace, sensitivity, and philosophical depth, supporting his arguments with searching studies of art and literature, high and low, from Thomas <i>Mann's Death in Venice</i> and Manet's <i>Olympia</i> to television. Throughout, the discussion of artworks is generously illustrated.</p><br><p> Beauty, Nehamas concludes, may depend on appearance, but this does not make it superficial. The perception of beauty manifests a hope that life would be better if the object of beauty were part of it. This hope can shape and direct our lives for better or worse. We may discover misery in pursuit of beauty, or find that beauty offers no more than a tantalizing promise of happiness. But if beauty is always dangerous, it is also a pressing human concern that we must seek to understand, and not suppress.</p></p><p><p>"The quality of the thought and writing of Nehamas's book assures that it will be required reading for a long time to come. It is the achievement of a wise and literate thinker in whose thought and life the topic of beauty is a matter of urgent and abiding concern. It takes readers into a discourse that in its nature addresses issues that arise in their own lives. Like truth and goodness, beauty is one of the determinants of human life, a fundamental value whose pertinence rules out the possibility that anyone can put it to rest and settle, once and for all, the problems that belong to its essence."--<b>Arthur C. Danto, Professor Emeritus, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Alexander Nehamas is one of the most imaginative philosophers of our day, as well as one of the most learned. In the past he has written brilliantly about both Plato and Nietzsche. In <i>Only a Promise of Happiness</i> he tries to reconcile the two by showing how their accounts of beauty complement each another. His attempt is novel and very ambitious. It seems to me almost completely successful."--<b>Richard Rorty, Professor Emeritus, Stanford University</b></p><p>"Alexander Nehamas's brave ambition is to bridge the gap between philosophy and art criticism. Writing as a philosopher with a great interest in art history, he uses a wide range of examples, from high art and mass art, from the visual arts and literature. Most philosophers in the analytic tradition write in a detached way. Nehamas, by contrast, presents an account of great feeling. This is a great, bravely provocative analysis. There is nothing else like this in the literature."--<b>David Carrier, Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Institute of Art</b></p><b>Alexander Nehamas</b> is Edmund N. Carpenter II Class of 1943 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University. He is the author of <i>Nietzsche: Life as Literature, The Art of Living: Socratic Reflections from Plato to Foucault,</i> and <i>Virtues of Authenticity: Essays on Plato and Socrates</i> (Princeton).</p><h2>For God, Country and Coca-Cola: The Unauthorized History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It</h2><p>The unauthorized history of the great American soft drink and the company that makes it. Pendergrast tells the full story of why Coke--more than 99% sweetened water--is the quintessential American product and how it changed the course of American capitalism. Also reveals high jinks, family dramas, and shady deals behind the scenes. Three 8-page photo inserts.</p><p>While the subtitle of Pendergrast's study suggests an ambush of Coca-Cola, the author obviously received at least semiofficial assistance in compiling his gossipy, essentially sympathetic history of a company that has attained cultural as well as commercial success. In a saga notable for vivid anecdotal detail, journalist Pendergrast toes the chronological line and appears more interested in telling lively tales than in providing a standard reference on the colossus of the soft-drink trade. The vastly entertaining, if episodic, narrative gets down to business with the story of Asa Candler, the Atlanta-based pharmacist who acquired rights to a patent medicine hawked as Pemberton's Tonic, renamed it Coca-Cola, and launched what became a multinational enterprise. The founding father's heirs sold out to Robert Woodruff in 1919; during his long tenure, the new patriarch single-mindedly focused on making the brand as familiar a symbol of America around the world as the stars and stripes. For over 90 of its 100-odd years, however, Coke has vied with upstart Pepsi for dominion in consumer outlets. Stung by the latter's steady inroads and cheeky ad campaigns, the young executives who took control of Coca-Cola during the 1980's ordered a change in the legendary formula. The public and press reacted furiously to any tampering with the flavor of the iconlike beverage, forcing the company to beat a hasty retreat. As Pendergrast makes clear, Coke has since recovered from this blunder and--despite ongoing problems with environmentalists, human-rights activists, and allied critics--has continued to expand its extraordinary franchise. A chatty, scrupulously documented account of a corporate phenomenon (and far more revealing than Elizabeth Candler Graham's The Real Ones, 1992) that's a bit like Coke itself: zesty and transiently refreshing. (Eight pages of photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Coca-Cola is one of the most celebrated products of this century. The trials and successes of Coke and its manufacturer, ranging from its invention to the wars with Pepsi, unfold in a historical narrative that keeps the reader focused and interested. Pendergrast, a business journalist, displays an impressive array of research from several collections and interviews with former company employees. The premise that Coca-Cola has religious undertones is somewhat far-fetched, but the author does an able job of proving that Coke is an American phenomenon. The last chapter, however, would have benefited from editing to make the transition from third to first person flow more smoothly. Recommended for general collections.<br><i>- Rebecca A.

The text block is as good as new and is full of photographic illustrations of Ramsomes life. Arthur Ransome is most famous as the author of Swallows and Amazons, but he was also a literary critic, a foreign correspondent, a fisherman and a sailor. The World of Arthur Ransome explores the places that shaped the writer. It tells the story of his childhood, his friendships, his two wives and daughter. It also describes how and where he wrote each of his twelve classic children&#39;s books, and the people and books that inspired them. There is no doubt that Ransome&#39;s spiritual home was the &#39;Lake in the North&#39; where he set five of his twelve iconic books for children. He holidayed on the banks of Coniston Water as a boy and camped there as a young man, but his most important and longest-lasting home was Low Ludderburn, on the slopes of Cartmel Fell and close to Lake Windermere. There he wrote Swallows and Amazons and three of its sequels. Another four of his books were set in East Anglia, where he moved so that he could sail on the Norfolk Broads and the east coast rivers around Pin Mill. Here shipboard domestic arrangements came to the fore: all the cabins of his boats were equipped with writing desks and a bookcase. He was never happier than when writing while afloat in his favourite little yacht, the Nancy Blackett, immortalized as Goblin in We Didn&#39;t Mean to Go To Sea. With a keen and affectionate eye, Christina Hardyment places this most loved of English authors in the settings which so richly define his work.. . .</p><p>Christina Hardyment has written books and articles on dizzying range of subjects (including her collection of historical sewing machines, domestic technology, family life and a biography of Sir Thomas Malory).

Fowler&#39;s brilliant translations provide access to six Homeric Hymns, eight selections from Bakchylides, twelve odes of Pindar, selections from the iambicists and elegists, virtually all of Archilochos and of the surviving lyricists, including Sappho, and a number of anonymous poems about work, play, and politics. Archaic poets delighted in all that was radiant and delicate, and their poems should be read for their narrative charm, celebration of nature, and playful sensuality. There are tantalizing fragments of fables here, as well as poems of friendship and warfare, love and colonization. Along with her notes and bibliography, Fowler has provided a biographical list of poets and a glossary of proper names. In addition to its breadth, Archaic Greek Poetry stands alone as the only volume of its kind translated by a contemporary published poet. Perhaps the most elegant translator of ancient Greek poetry into modern English, Barbara Hughes Fowler offers translations true to the original Greek while providing modern readers with superb examples of the beauty of lyric poetry. Students and scholars of classical and comparative literature, ancient history, and art history, as well as lovers of lyric poetry, will enthusiastically welcome this volume.</p><p>Barbara Hughes Fowler is John Bascom Professor of Classics Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

At this level students must take more responsibility for the content and appearance of their work. Until now, there has been no text to assist this process. This book will enable such students to edit and present their work in a professional and thoughtful manner. Additionally, the book will help students develop a helpful critical vocabulary for discussing and interpreting images.</p><p>This book introduces photographers, print-makers and other graphic artists to the creative possibilities of image editing and presentation. The focus is on how meaning can be created and shaped if the emphasis is placed on the totality of the visual experience rather than by looking at each image in isolation. In the first instance there is a discussion of a variety of ways images can be grouped together. This act has implications for how the work should subsequently be presented. To this end there is a discussion of various presentation techniques, and how each different forum can further amplify the desired effect. Finally there is a hands-on look at a variety of presentation techniques such as artist book publishing, exhibition design and portfolio construction that will help the reader to present his or her work in a professional manner. By employing the principles outlined in this book readers can expect that the content of their work will be more coherent and accessible, not only to an audience, but also more importantly, to themselves.Douglas Holleley PhD is an experienced and devoted teacher.

With an unswerving concern for every American soldier trapped by enemy fire, and a fearlessness that became legendary, Ron Alexander earned enough official praise to become the second most decorated helicopter pilot of the Vietnam era. Yet, for Ron, the real reward came from plucking his fellow soldiers from harm's way, giving them another chance to get home alive.<br><br>In <i>Taking Fire</i>, Alexander and acclaimed military writer Charles Sasser transport you right into the cramped cockpit of a Huey on patrol, offering a bird's eye view of the Vietnam conflict. Packed with riveting action and gritty "you-are-there" dialogue, this outstanding book celebrates the everyday heroism of the chopper pilots of Vietnam.<br></p><p>Ron Alexander lives and teaches in Oklahoma. This is his first book.<br><br>Charles Sasser is a combat veteran with time in Vietnam and Central America as a war correspondant. He has been a full-time freelance writer/journalist since 1979 and has over 30 published books to his name. He lives in Oklahoma.<br>Now a high school math teacher, Alexander tells his Vietnam War story with the help of Sasser (Always a Warrior; etc.) in this combat-heavy memoir. Most army helicopter pilots in the Vietnam War were young, rapidly trained warrant officers. Alexander was an exception. After a year of college, he joined the army in 1964, went Airborne, completed Officer Candidate School and then learned to fly helicopters. He arrived in Vietnam as a lieutenant in 1969 and flew scores of missions with the 1st Cavalry Division. Alexander and Sasser use much obviously reconstructed dialogue, some admittedly "re-created" scenes and a mixture of real and made-up names. They also pepper the narrative with profanity, disparaging terms for Vietnamese and helicopter techno talk, all of which dilutes the book's impact. However, they succeed quite well in evoking the Vietnam War from the point of view of a helicopter pilot who served bravely and with distinction. They also convincingly convey Alexander's changing feelings about the war. While he initially tried to avoid serving in the war, once in Vietnam he "embraced the war" as a fervent anti-Communist patriot. After months of heavy combat, though, Alexander had "second thoughts" about the war. Although he continued to serve honorably, Alexander's main goal in the final months of his Vietnam tour was to come home alive and in one piece. He succeeded.

But the garden, described by Virginia Woolf on her arrival in 1916 as "charming. . . now run rather wild" became and remained central to life in the farmhouse. The walled garden, created by Vanessa Bell and Roger Fry from the vegetable garden after the war, as well as the pond, the orchard, and the lawns which shade off into the fields, all contributed in a major sense to the creative energies of the place. And this creativity is reflected in the numerous works of art in stone, in wood, in brick, and in ceramic that Bell, Fry, Duncan Grant, and the next generation &#x2014; notably Quentin Bell &#x2014; contributed to the garden to enhance (and sometimes to comment on or to counterpoint) the simple but expressive planting schemes. Now, for the first time, the year-round charm and glory of this most English and most artistic of gardens has been captured by one of Britain's leading garden photographers.</p><p>Sue Snell is a leading documentary and horticultural photographer and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

Joanne Meyerowitz tells a powerful human story about people who had a deep and unshakable desire to transform their bodily sex. In the last century when many challenged the social categories and hierarchies of race, class, and gender, transsexuals questioned biological sex itself, the category that seemed most fundamental and fixed of all. </p><p> From early twentieth-century sex experiments in Europe, to the saga of Christine Jorgensen, whose sex-change surgery made headlines in 1952, to today's growing transgender movement, Meyerowitz gives us the first serious history of transsexuality. She focuses on the stories of transsexual men and women themselves, as well as a large supporting cast of doctors, scientists, journalists, lawyers, judges, feminists, and gay liberationists, as they debated the big questions of medical ethics, nature versus nurture, self and society, and the scope of human rights. </p><p> In this story of transsexuality, Meyerowitz shows how new definitions of sex circulated in popular culture, science, medicine, and the law, and she elucidates the tidal shifts in our social, moral, and medical beliefs over the twentieth century, away from sex as an evident biological certainty and toward an understanding of sex as something malleable and complex. <i>How Sex Changed</i> is an intimate history that illuminates the very changes that shape our understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality today. </p></p><p><b>Joanne Meyerowitz</b> is Professor of History at Indiana University and Editor of the <i>Journal of American History</i>.Meyerowitz's easy, readable style makes her thorough research in a wide range of fields accessible and enjoyable, even when she is detailing such subjects as internecine fighting among psychiatrists over the merits of sex-change operations...[<i>How Sex Changed</i>] is an invaluable introduction to how ideas about gender and sexuality have evolved. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2002-07-01)<br><br>[A] fascinating account of how transsexuality has challenged American concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality in science, medicine, law, and popular culture in the 20th century...With her sympathetic reporting on the lives of individual men and women coming to terms with their transsexuality--especially Jorgensen, who lived until 1989--Meyerowitz gives serious social history an engaging human face. Informative and absorbing. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2002-08-01)<br><br>This unusually intelligent and straightforward cultural history...convincingly shows that our coming to view "biological sex"--the physical markers of femininity and masculinity--as malleable rather than immutable constituted one of the most profound moral, social, legal, and medical changes in twentieth-century America. (<i>The Atlantic</i> 2002-09-01)<br><br>Meyerowitz, teacher and editor...uses both skills to explain a confusing subject and pilot readers through a morass of changing terminology and interpretations...The book might have bogged down in the anatomical, chromosomal, psychological, and social aspects of the differences between men and women, but Meyerowitz avoids this by maintaining focus on major trends and attitudes. She cites carefully chosen persons, organizations, and publications to demonstrate the gradual development of the now generally accepted idea of maleness and femaleness occupying a qualitative continuum rather than representing polar conditions. Detailed and informative, and well supported by references and notes, Meyerowitz's work is commendable to anyone seriously interested in transsexuality. (<i>Booklist</i> 2002-09-15)<br><br>[<i>How Sex Changed</i>] examines changing definitions of gender through the prism of transsexuality, that most mysterious of conditions in which a person is born with normal chromosomes and hormones for one sex but is convinced that he or she is a member of the other. Dr. Meyerowitz shows how mutable the words "male," "female," "sex," and "gender" have become, and how their meanings have evolved through time. Hers is one of several new books on the subject of the transgendered...In terms of the scientific quandary of gender, [this book] is the most important. (Dinitia Smith <i>New York Times</i> 2002-10-29)<br><br><i>How Sex Changed</i> is a sober, comprehensive cultural history that draws on previously unavailable archival sources. It is likely to become a standard reference in the field. <i>How Sex Changed</i> follows the growing self-identification and assertiveness of transsexuals in American society. One of its great strengths is its examination of the intersection and interaction of science and culture, a type of inquiry that should serve as a model for future work on gender issues...[This is] an intelligent, even indispensable, account. (Julia M. Klein <i>The Nation</i> 2002-12-02)<br><br>Meyerowitz details the advancement of medical treatments for transsexuals along with accompanying changes in the scientific as well as the popular lexicon...Though doctors have published a number of medical texts on transsexuality, and several transsexuals have published their autobiographies, Meyerowitz's book stands out as a comprehensive, scholarly volume that incorporates research from a wide range of sources, including the perspectives of many transgender people themselves. (Amanda Laughtland <i>The Progressive</i> 2002-12-01)<br><br>A thorough and fascinating academic study...Meyerowitz in this fine book uses the history of transsexuality and the narrative arc of Jorgensen's story as a means by which to study our ever evolving notions of man and woman, sex and gender. The key word here is evolving. We haven't figured anything out, but at least we're asking questions. (Jonathan Ames <i>Bookforum</i> 2002-12-01)<br><br>Gender is a fundamental part of human identity, yet for some people the question, "Male or female?" is not easily answered. These individuals feel they are trapped in the wrong body. Their history, and especially their efforts to change their bodies through surgical and medical interventions, is the subject of this new book by Joanne Meyerowitz...This is a scientific work, but Meyerowitz keeps the very human side of the issue front and center throughout. (<i>Psychology Today</i> 2003-02-01)<br><br>In addition to examining these definitional battles, Meyerowitz details how transsexuality became a lens through which post-war American culture's concerns with "the limits of individualism, the promises and pitfalls of science, the appropriate behavior of women and men, and the boundaries of acceptable gender expression" were refracted. She uses the story of Jorgensen's personal transformation to frame a riveting social, medical and cultural history of transsexualism in the United States...The richness of Meyerowitz' incisive and accessible history lies in the breadth and depth of her research.

Beginning with the discovery of the Ohio River by La Salle and ending with the Civil War, this region was the West, the exciting new frontier. Written with the power and compression of folklore, these tales bring to life the unmemorialized common folks who carried out this epic adventure. In these pages, you will meet preachers and profiteers, the boy who saved Cleveland, a love-crossed carpenter, generals and journalists, a hermit and a lawyer, farmers and bone collectors, lovers, layabouts, and a host of other high-spirited characters the kind of people who, in all ages, have made history. These stories, which condense entire lifetimes into single paragraphs, come out of a distinctive tradition in American literature. For this book reflects the experience of settling our entire wild, raucous, dangerous, and glorious continent. Our ancestors went through very much the same trials everywhere, from New England to California and Alaska. They wrestled with the land and its inhabitants for more than two centuries before there were any cities or industries to speak of, and since we have all been shaped by that prolonged wrestling, this encounter with the wilderness is one of the deepest, truest, and most abiding subjects in our literature.</p><p>Born in Tennessee and reared in Ohio, Scott Russell Sanders studied in Rhode Island and in Cambridge, England, before going on to become a Distinguished Professor of English at Indiana University. Among his honors are the Mark Twain Award, the Lannan Literary Award, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He and his wife, Ruth, a biochemist, have reared two children in their hometown of Bloomington, in the hardwood hill country of Indiana&#39;s White River Valley.It would be difficult to find richer, more concise prose than that employed by Scott Sanders in this collection. ... Most of these tales resonate with the force of fine lyric poetry, and they come together beautifully to project aspects of the epic an American epic. ... [Wilderness Plots] is a stunning achievement. --The Georgia Review<br><br>Sanders's skillful writing makes these Ohio Valley pioneers come alive. He has written vignettes of two or three pages each about the odd and memorable people, and incidents that were talked about for years; the sort of thing that never seems to find its way into history volumes with any regularity. ... This is one of the best books of folk history around. --Sacramento (California) Bee<br><br>The language of these tales is chiseled, spare to the point of folklore: every word carries a lovely weight. ... Seldom has America's early story been so beautifully told. ... The book should appeal to anyone interested in Americana. It almost demands rereading: some may find its cumulative effect similar to that of Edgar Lee Masters's Spoon River Anthology. --Publishers' Weekly</p><h2>Dragon Knights, Vol. 14</h2><p>When the Demon Hordes threaten the kingdom of Dusis, the Dragon Lord and his tribe must use the magical dragon swords to protect their peace and prosperity.</p><p>Cutting edge graphics mixed with compelling stories. 100% Authentic Manga Format.

Combining an impressive array of images with both critical and biographical texts and personal reflections not only enhances the visual impact of each photographer's work but also serves to place it in the context of our growing body of photo analysis. Interestingly, beginning the series with these books shows how two photographers can both excel and yet work so far apart within the medium. Thus, Allard takes pictures of moments, of people, of places well outside the mainstream. The convergence of eye, available light, and trusting subject makes his work powerful and memorable. Demarchelier works like a craftsman with light, color, and beautiful models to achieve nearly geometric compositions of human form.

As a theoretical biologist, Robert Rosen saw this as the most fundamental of all questions-and yet it had never been answered satisfactorily by science. The answers to this question would allow humanity to make an enormous leap forward in our understanding of the principles at work in our world.<br><br>For centuries, it was believed that the only scientific approach to the question "What is life?" must proceed from the Cartesian metaphor (organism as machine). Classical approaches in science, which also borrow heavily from Newtonian mechanics, are based on a process called "reductionism." The thinking was that we can better learn about an intricate, complicated system (like an organism) if we take it apart, study the components, and then reconstruct the system-thereby gaining an understanding of the whole.<br><br>However, Rosen argues that reductionism does not work in biology and ignores the complexity of organisms. <i>Life Itself</i>, a landmark work, represents the scientific and intellectual journey that led Rosen to question reductionism and develop new scientific approaches to understanding the nature of life. Ultimately, Rosen proposes an answer to the original question about the causal basis of life in organisms. He asserts that renouncing the mechanistic and reductionistic paradigm does not mean abandoning science. Instead, Rosen offers an alternate paradigm for science that takes into account the relational impacts of organization in natural systems and is based on organized matter rather than on particulate matter alone.<br><br>Central to Rosen's work is the idea of a "complex system," defined as any system that cannot be fully understood by reducing it to its parts. In this sense, complexity refers to the causal impact of organization on the system as a whole. Since both the atom and the organism can be seen to fit that description, Rosen asserts that complex organization is a general feature not just of the biosphere on Earth-but of the universe itself.</p><p>What is life? For four centuries, it has been believed that the only possible scientific approach to this question proceeds from the Cartesian metaphor&#x2015;organism as machine. Therefore, organisms are to be studied and characterized the same way "machines" are; the same way any inorganic system is. Robert Rosen argues that such a view is neither necessary nor sufficient to answer the question. He asserts that life is not a specialization of mechanism, but rather a sweeping generalization of it. Above all, Rosen argues that renouncing mechanism does not mean abandoning science. A radical alternative is proposed, drawn equally from experience in biology, physics, and mathematics; an alternative which draws attention to a new class of complex systems, which are radically different from mechanism.Dr. Robert Rosen (1934-1998) was a prominent theorist in the areas of biology and biophysics and taught and conducted research at various universities for over three decades. He was the author of thirteen books, including <i>Anticipatory Systems</i>; <i>Fundamentals of Measurement and Representation of Natural Systems</i>; <i>Rosennean Complexity</i>; and <i>The Limits of the Limits of Science</i>.</p><h2>Figure and Form</h2><p>Please contact us for further information about this book.</p><p></p><h2>DEGAS: His Life, Times and Work</h2><p>Recounts the life and career of the great French impressionist, describes his complex personality, and discusses his painting style and experiments</p><p></p><h2>Biggles Delivers the Goods</h2><p>While in Malaya on a secret mission Algy is captured after his plane goes down but Biggles does not abandon him.

Belinda's going to do ballet, Tiki's planned a magic act, but Ella doesn't have a single idea. She can't sing, dance, or play an instrument -- doesn't Ella have any talent at all?<br><br>Then comes the night of the big show, and Ella discovers her own special talent that shines very bright -- even when she's not in the limelight. Carmela and Steve D'Amico put friendship center stage in this third charming elephant adventure.</p><p>Carmela D'Amico grew up with the modest goal of trying her hand at everything once. As of today, she's completed about 32% of her mission. Meanwhile, she documents her interest in everything under the sun by writing kids books, young adult fiction, essays, poems and anything else that strikes her fancy.<br><br>Steve D'Amico began drawing dinosaurs and superheroes at the age of five and was the cartoonist for his high school newspaper. Eventually he became Senior Art Director at Seattle-based Smashing Ideas where he designed and illustrated numerous games and websites for kids. Steve is the illustrator of several children's books, including the award-winning Ella The Elephant books, which became an animated TV series in 2014. He continues to illustrate and has two new books due out in 2015."Ella, the elegant but shy elephant, has a new challenge in this third entry in the successful series.<br>This time her school is planning a talent show and all the little elephants have their acts planned&#x2013;<br>except Ella. She struggles to find her own special ability, unsuccessfully trying to play the drums,<br>juggle or sing. Finally, Ella takes over the organization of the talent show, including providing<br>refreshments, making backstage costume repairs and rescuing Lola the monkey. Ella is recognized on<br>stage for her contributions, and in the satisfying conclusion, she realizes that she does indeed have her<br>own valuable talent: organizational ability. The calm, confident tone of the text is a fine match for the<br>whimsical illustrations that convey Ella's charmingly old-fashioned world on Elephant Island. Though<br>the story has a nostalgic flavor, Ella's concerns are timeless." --<i>Kirkus</i><br>"Another lovely entry about an endearing elephant. Ella is desperately worried about her school's upcoming talent show. Her shyness and lack of a "special natural ability" seem to preclude her participation. From juggling to singing, she tries various activities with disastrous results. Still, she helps to organize the event and assists her classmates, and, on the big night, her true gift&#x2013;being a good friend&#x2013;shines forth. The book's charming, old-fashioned quality is emphasized by fluid illustrations reminiscent of those in the "Babar" and "Curious George" series. However, while the simplicity of the character depictions will make readers smile, it sometimes results in a lack of expression on the elephants' faces. Regardless, color and shadow are masterfully used to emphasize the main action in each scene while providing a richly detailed background. The story is driven by short bursts of dialogue, and key points are highlighted by moments of introspection. While primary-grade children will best sympathize with Ella's frustration and her conflicted feelings about being in the spotlight, younger children who have ever felt left out, inept, or just a little bit different will also find the story appealing." -- <i>School Library Journal</i><br>"Ella, the adorable little elephant last seen in Ella Takes the Cake (2005), gets bad news&#x2013;&#x2013;there's going to be a talent show at her school. Shy, and sure she has no talent, Ella brushes off suggestions that she recite a poem, and her attempts at juggling fail. Ella isn't shy about helping the talent show committee, however, painting signs, making medals, and planning the program. On the day of the show, she still doesn't know what she's going to do, but she's soon busy sewing a hole in a dancer's tights and helping a performer's monkey jump from the rafters. Prizes are handed out, but the applause goes to Ella for being "a very special friend." The question of Ella's performance is dropped midway, only to appear again the day of the show, but children will be probably be too entranced to worry about particulars. With artwork that evokes the best of picture-book art of the mid-twentieth century (Bemelmans, Rey, DeBrunhoff) and take a cozy look at childhood concerns, this is one both kids and parents will enjoy." --<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>Story of the Walnut Tree</h2><p>Inspired by an account given by President Gordon B.

From the promising new Portraits series, this historical novel takes place in the 1870s in Paris, where Sylvie is a little rat,&#x201d; or young pupil of the Paris Opera Ballet. She strives to dance well and to grow three-quarters of an inch so that she can join the ballet, while her widowed mother takes in laundry to make ends meet. When war comes to Paris, it brings hardship, hunger, death, and occasionally the closing of the opera house. To Sylvie, this period of upheaval brings challenges and loss but also growth in understanding and independence, as well as inches. The artist Degas makes cameo appearances, and one of his paintings is used on the cover. Though readers may be unfamiliar with this historical period, they will be swept along by the strong story line. Young dancers will particularly enjoy the evocative passages when Sylvie is on stage or in class. Link this to Carolyn Meyer's Marie, Dancing (2005).

Many fashion designers extend their aesthetic into interiors and products for the home as a natural progression from clothing the body. <p>The home is now subject to the same directional trends as fashion, in part because so many designers are extending their practice to include interiors, as well as products, and accessories. The fusion between fashion and interiors has never been more relevant. The proliferation of ideas, the speed of manufacture, and an increasingly visually literate consumer, have all resulted in interiors being subject to the same desire for fashionability, innovation and change as fashion. This investigation of the hectic dissemination of trends takes the reader on an eclectic, adventurous excursion into living with fashion.</p></p><p>Marnie Fogg works as a lecturer in fashion and culture at the University of Nottingham, England.

Printz Award; a former National Ambassador for Young People's Literature; and an inaugural NYC Literary Honoree. Myers received every single major award in the field of children's literature. He was the author of two Newbery Honor Books and six Coretta Scott King Awardees. He was the recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults, a three-time National Book Award Finalist, as well as the first-ever recipient of the Coretta Scott King-Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><br><br><p>When Ross Workman was thirteen, he wrote a fan email to his favorite author. When Walter Dean Myers wrote back and asked him whether he would be interested in writing a book, Ross was amazed&#x2014;and incredibly excited. Four years later, Ross is seventeen and in eleventh grade. In addition to writing, Ross plays a sport every season: high school soccer in the fall, high school wrestling in the winter, and club travel soccer in the spring. He lives in New Jersey.</p>Gr 6-9-In an interesting joint effort, Myers teamed with high school student Workman to produce this novel about a soccer player who runs into trouble helping a friend. Veteran police sergeant Jerry Brown is asked to look into the case of a 13-year-old boy who crashed a car belonging to his friend&#39;s father. Brown takes a special interest in the case when he is informed that the boy, Kevin Johnson, is the son of an officer who was killed in the line of duty. As Brown delves more deeply, he begins to suspect that the friend&#39;s family has something to hide. He also develops a bond with Kevin, who, although angry and troubled, is basically kindhearted and well-intentioned. Workman wrote the chapters narrated by the boy, and Myers wrote those narrated by Brown. This approach works quite well in terms of narrative voice, as Myers&#39;s more polished style reflects an adult perspective, while Workman&#39;s less-refined prose seems appropriate to his character&#39;s outlook and experience. There is some exciting soccer action, and the interaction between Brown and Kevin is heartwarming, yet natural and unforced. While some may feel that the denouement falls a little flat, the novel should have wide appeal to soccer fans, aspiring writers, and boys from difficult family circumstances who are trying to figure out how to make their way in the world.-Richard Luzer, Fair Haven Union High School, VT (c) Copyright 2010.

In <i>Quick Studies</i> a physicist humiliates the gurus of postmodernism in an astonishing hoax; the "Dirty Harry" of literary theory renounces his calling; a Romanian dissident is assassinated in a faculty lavatory; and a leading feminist faces charges of sexual harassment.<br><br>Anyone concerned with the key debates of our time, and their idiosyncratic debaters, cannot afford to miss this book.

He is currently the Ideas editor of <i>The Boston Globe. </i>His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>.<br><br>Lingua Franca chronicled the strange and boisterous controversies in academia-from a feminist professor accused of sexual harassment to the debate over which crustacean the "pair of ragged claws" belonged to in T.S. Eliot's "Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"-throughout the 1990s, steering a narrow course between theory-loving academics and the journalists and pundits who revile them. Although it folded in last year's economic tumult, the consistently crisp, thoughtful, lively writing in these 40 pieces is hardly that of a fly-by-night publication. Selected by long-time LF editor Star, the reportage, essays and profiles include a poignant account of novelist Milan Kundera's fallings-out with his translators as he struggled hopelessly to find the perfect English translations of his work; a profile of Xanax-popping prankster Slavoj Zizek, the Slovenian philosopher who once slipped subversive messages into Communist propaganda; and a stinging self-denunciation by a former literary theorist who has turned against jargon-laden academic criticism. Other subjects include the Yale graduate student strike; Yugoslavian Marxist dissidents who became committed to Serbian nationalism; and primatologists' blinding love of bonobo chimps. Full of memorable characters and colorful conflicts, the pieces do justice to the complexity of the intellectual and social questions at stake. In his introduction, Star notes that in spite of the awards and accolades the magazine received, its circulation remained relatively small. That means there are a lot of people who missed these pieces the first time around.

His idea of a crime-fighting, daring, dynamic duo � la Bruce and Dick (Batman and Robin) is Twain and Einstein (Mark and Albert)&#x2014;that is, when it&#x2019;s not a snake and a strip of bacon. When he thinks Odd Couple, it&#x2019;s Oscar and Felix Dracula. His fearless expos�, &#x201c;Moon 69, the True Story of the 1969 Moon Launch,&#x201d; reveals that the astronauts were reprieved death-row convicts and that, besides stowaways, coroner Quincy, a ventriloquist, and Woodward and Bernstein were along for the ride. Between thrizzles, he advertises products (&#x201c;slightly cursed merchandise,&#x201d; &#x201c;tiny animals to put in your pants&#x201d;), job opportunities (&#x201c;cockney grave robber&#x201d;), and sister publications (Weird Sandwich Magazine, Show Me Your Wiener!). Kupperman draws all this strangeness in a manner that derives about equally from Chester Gould (Dick Tracy), 1950s romance comics, visual-pun cartoonist Glen Baxter, and art deco. He&#x2019;s not afraid of, as he boasts on the cover of Tales #6, &#x201c;too much color.&#x201d; Fans of extreme comic incongruity should be thoroughly&#x2014;what else?&#x2014;thrizzled. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Unbounded Practice: Women and Landscape Architecture in the Early Twentieth Century</h2><p><p>Women have practiced as landscape architects for over a century, since the founding of the practice as a profession in the United States in the 1890s. They came to landscape architecture as gardeners, garden designers, horticulturalists, and fine artists. They simultaneously shaped the profession while reflecting contemporary practice. It is all the more surprising, then, that the history of women in American landscape design has received relatively little attention. Tha�sa Way corrects this oversight in <i>Unbounded Practice: Women and Landscape Architecture in the Early Twentieth Century. </i>Describing design practice in landscape architecture during the first half of the twentieth century, the book serves as a narrative both of women&#x2015;such as Beatrix Jones Farrand, Marian Cruger Coffin, Annette Hoyt Flanders, Ellen Biddle Shipman, Martha Brookes Hutcheson, and Marjorie Sewell Cautley&#x2015;and of the practice as it became a profession.</p><p>Winner of a 2008 David R.

They guide readers through several Hermetic teachings, shed light on the New Thought spiritual movement, explain how the Christ mythos and Jewish kabbalistic texts borrowed from the Hermetic tradition, and reveal how many of today's get-rich-quick schemes have roots in Hermetic laws. While not for everyone, this book provides an unbiased view of the teachings of secret societies and will interest many patrons. Recommended for all libraries. -- <i>By Deborah Bigelow, Director, Leonia P.L., NJ -- Library Journal, 1/15/2008</i><br><br>The success of Rhonda Byrne's self-help manual The Secret, while undoubtedly noteworthy, is somewhat baffling considering that the subject matter is nothing more then the age old "Law of Attraction". Byrne has taken an idea as old as any alchemical school of thought and turned it into a mantra to make a quick buck and lose weight fast. In Secret Source: The Law of Attraction Is One of Seven Ancient Hermetic Laws: Here Are the Other Six authors Maja D'aoust and Adam Parfrey break down the ancient Hermetic teachings that have led to the recent outbreak of self-help ideas and schools of New Thought that are taking over the gullible masses. <p>The Law of Attraction seems to be the most popular of the Hermetic laws but it isn't the only one. The belief system behind these laws goes back thousands of years and has been studied, and expanded upon, by some of the greatest philosophical minds of the ages. The authors break down each law in turn, explaining its significance and how it interrelates to the other laws. They also go into great detail about the volumes that inspired so much of the ideas, such as The Emerald Tablet and The Kybalion. The reader is introduced to not only the minds that gave birth to these ideas but those that carried it into the various New Thought movements. </p><p>Though the subject matter is at times a little deep and the philosophies can be somewhat esoteric, the authors have done a good job of laying everything out in terms that are understandable without being dumbed-down. They strip the "secret" out of The Secret and show that the Law of Attraction isn't something that should be trifled with for greedy personal gain. For anyone who thinks that they may have found the answer in The Secret, I highly suggest that you make this book your next selection. -- <i>By: Elizabeth Headrick | 01.25.08 | filed under: Stranger Than Fiction: Book Fetish By: Elizabeth Headrick | 01.25.08 | Stranger Than Fiction: Book Fetish</i></p></p><h2>Death&#39;s Shadow: Wolf Island</h2><p>The king of horror&#39;s demonic symphony in ten volumes, now available in omnibus editions -- each containing two titles in the spine-chilling Demonata series.

In the Roman Empire no one is safe from the sting of betrayal: man, woman&#x2014;or child.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a boy, Nero&#x2019;s royal heritage becomes a threat to his very life, first when the mad emperor Caligula tries to drown him, then when his great aunt attempts to secure her own son&#x2019;s inheritance. Faced with shocking acts of treachery, young Nero is dealt a harsh lesson: it is better to be cruel than dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> While Nero idealizes the artistic and athletic principles of Greece, his very survival rests on his ability to navigate the sea of vipers that is Rome. The most lethal of all is his own mother, a cold-blooded woman whose singular goal is to control the empire. With cunning and poison, the obstacles fall one by one. But as Agrippina&#x2019;s machinations earn her son a title he is both tempted and terrified to assume, Nero&#x2019;s determination to escape her thrall will shape him into the man he was fated to become&#x2014;an Emperor who became legendary.<br> &nbsp;<br> With impeccable research and captivating prose, <i>The Confessions of Young Nero</i> is the story of a boy&#x2019;s ruthless ascension to the throne.

So I am hopeful that this is a sham and that the new emperor, Galba, will soon need my unique services and quietly send for me and once again I shall be treading the palace halls. I feel at home there, and why shouldn't I? I have provided my timely services for those in power for many years.<br><br>By trade I am a poisoner. There, why not say it? And not any old poisoner, but the acknowledged expert and leader in my profession. So many others want to be another Locusta, another me. So I founded an academy to pass on my knowledge and train the next generation, for Rome will always be in need of poisoners. I should lament that, should say what a pity that Rome must descend to that, but that would be hypocritical of me. Besides, I am not convinced that poison is not the best way to die. Think of all the other ways a person may die at the hands of Rome: being torn by beasts in the arena, being strangled in the Tullianum prison, and, most insipid of all, being ordered to open your veins and bleed yourself to death, like a sacrificial animal. Bah. Give me a good poison anytime. Did not Cleopatra embrace the asp and its poison, leaving her beautiful and stretched out upon her couch?<br><br>I first met the late emperor Nero when he was still a child, still Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, the name he was born with. I saw him at the low point in his life, when he was an abandoned child at the mercy of his uncle Caligula. (Now, that was someone who gave me a lively string of business!) His father was dead, his mother, Agrippina, had been banished when he was not even three years old, and his uncle liked to toy with him.<br><br>I remember he was a likable child-well, he remained likable all his life; it was a gift-but timorous. Many things frightened him, especially loud noises and being sent for unexpectedly. Caligula had a habit of that-sending for people in the middle of the night. He once forced me to watch a nocturnal theatrical performance in the palace, featuring himself as Jupiter. Sometimes it was harmless, like the playacting; other times it ended with the death of the helpless person he had sent for. So, Nero-let us call him that to avoid confusion, just as I call Caligula Caligula rather than Gaius Caesar Germanicus-was precocious in recognizing the danger of the serpent in his uncle.<br><br>Ah, such memories! Here in my cell I find myself returning to them, helping the hours to pass, until that moment when Galba sends for me with a task. I know he will!<br><br>II<br><br>Nero<br><br>The moon was round and full. It shone on the flat surface of the lake, which was also round, making it appear that the moon itself had expanded and enlarged itself there. It rose golden from the encircling hills but soon was a bright white ball high above.<br><br>It illuminated the wide deck of the ship. I was to sit beside my uncle and listen to him intoning praise to the goddess Diana, whose sanctuary was on the shore of the lake and to whom the lake itself was sacred.<br><br>I remember the flame of the torches that threw a flickering red light on the faces around me, in contrast to the clear bluish-white moonlight bathing the wider scene. My uncle's face looked not like a human's but like a demon's, with a burning hue.<br><br>These are all impressions, memories that swirl without being attached to anything. The reflection on the water-the torches-the thin, reedy voice of my uncle-the nervous laughter around me-the chill in the air-<br><br>I was only three years old, so it is no wonder my memories are disconnected.<br><br>Then his face shoved up into mine, his silky voice saying, "What shall I do with the bitch's whelp?"<br><br>More nervous laughter. His rough hands grabbed my shoulders and hauled me up, my legs dangling helplessly.<br><br>"I shall sacrifice him to the goddess!" He strode over to the rail and held me over the rippling water. I can still see the undulation of the reflected moonlight, waiting for me. "She wants a human sacrifice, and what more worthy than this kin of mine, descendant of the divine Augustus? Only the best for Diana, and perhaps a propitiation for the lapse of Augustus, who preferred to worship her brother Apollo. There you go!"<br><br>And I was flung out over the water, landing with a splash, cold, cold, and I sank, unable to swim or even cry out. Then strong hands grasped me, pulled me mercifully out of the water, and I could breathe. I was hauled onto the deck, where my uncle stood, hands on hips, laughing.<br><br>"Better luck next time, eh, Chaerea? You are too softhearted, to rescue such flotsam. Anything born of my sister can come to no good."<br><br>III<br><br>As I sat shivering next to Chaerea I could see down the whole length of the huge boat, see the light dancing on the mosaic-covered deck, the moonlight shining on the white marble cabin. The madman who had thrown me in the water now paced up and down, laughing. Not until I was older did I hear such a laugh again, and it was from a captive hyena, whining and mewling in its cage.<br><br>Let me off, let me off, let me off this boat, I prayed, to what god I knew not, just whatever god was listening.<br><br>"Come, lad," said Chaerea, putting his huge arm around my shoulders. "You should walk, warm up." He pulled me up and marched me up and down the deck, until feeling returned to my numb feet. We passed the rowers, whose heads turned as if on stalks to see us as we passed. One or two smiled. The others looked like the statues that were placed here and there on the deck.<br><br>"The shore is close," said Chaerea, holding me up and pointing to it. "Soon we will be back on it."<br><br>How I got back and when I got back I do not know. I have told you, my memories are wispy from this early age and do not join together to make a whole; rather, they are like pieces of cloud drifting through the sky of my mind, each portion separate and contained. But the horrible memory of the boat ride is burned into my mind.<br><br>My little bed in my aunt�s home, where I lived, was narrow and hard; I can feel the rough linen when I think about it, but cannot see what else is in the room. I know the place was in the country because I heard roosters crow in the morning and I remember gathering eggs, still warm, from a bed of straw. I also remember many kinds of butterflies, and flowers on tall stalks, although I know now those were weeds.<br><br>I called my aunt Butterfly because one of her names was Lepida, which means elegant and graceful, and she was very pretty. Her hair was the reddish color of copper with a bit of dust on it, not the bright shiny copper that has just been polished. She was my father's younger sister and told me stories about him-he who had died before I could know him-and about their ancestors. When I told her how the sun made her hair glow, she laughed and said, "Bronze hair is in our family. I can see little glints of it in yours, too, even though it's mainly blond. Shall I tell you the story about how it came to be that color?"<br><br>"Oh, yes!" I settled in next to her, hoping it would be a long story.<br><br>"Well, long ago one of our ancestors saw two tall and handsome young men standing in the road."<br><br>"Were they gods?" I guessed. Whenever tall strangers appeared out of nowhere, they were gods.<br><br>"Indeed they were-the twin gods Castor and Pollux. They told our ancestor that the Romans had won a great battle, and to go to Rome and tell everyone. To prove that they were gods and telling the truth, they reached out and touched his beard, and it turned instantly from black to red. So from then on the family was called Ahenobarbus-Bronze Beard."<br><br>"Did my father have a red beard?" I wanted to know more about him. I wanted to hear that he was a hero and famous and that his death had been tragic. I later found out he was none of the above.<br><br>"Oh, yes. He was a true Ahenobarbus. Another unusual thing about our family is that all the men have only two personal names-Lucius and Gnaeus. Your father was a Gnaeus and you are a Lucius. Your grandfather, also a Lucius, was a consul but also a chariot racer. A famous one, too."<br><br>I had little ivory play chariots, and I loved racing them against one another on the floor. "When can I drive a chariot?"<br><br>Aunt Butterfly cocked her head, smiling. "Not for a while yet. You have to be very strong to race chariots. The horses pull the reins from your hands unless you hold very tight, and the chariot bounces and you have to be careful not to fall out, which is very dangerous."<br><br>"Maybe I could have a little chariot, pulled by ponies?"<br><br>"Perhaps," she said. "But you are still too young even for that."<br><br>I do remember this conversation about the chariots and the red beards. But why I was living with Aunt Butterfly, and what had happened to my mother and father, I still did not know. I knew my father was dead, but I did not know about my mother. All I knew was that she was not there.<br><br>Aunt gave me two teachers. One was named Paris and he was an actor and a dancer. The other was named Castor and he was a barber. He shaved the beard of Aunt�s husband (who did not have a bronze beard but a regular brown one) and sewed up cuts and did other handy things. Paris was only for fun. I could not see that he did anything but act and pretend to be someone else. First he would tell a story-usually it was about a Greek, because they seemed to have the best stories-and then he would pretend to be those people. In real life, he was dark and not very tall. But when he played Apollo, I swear he grew tall before my eyes and his hair lightened.<br><br>"No, little one," he would say, laughing. "That is only your imagination. It is the actor's job to make you see and hear things inside your own head."<br><br>"Does an actor do magic?"<br><br>He glanced around; a frightened look flitted over his eyes. "Of course not! The magic happens only in your own thoughts."<br><br>It was not long before I learned that practicing magic was forbidden, and that there was just such practice going on in that household.<br><br>In some ways it was odd to be the only child in the household. I did not have anyone to play with except Paris-who was childlike in many ways but still an adult-and the children who were slaves. Aunt did not like my playing with them but she could not be watching all the time, and what did she expect me to do? Let me say it: I was lonely. Lonely as in alone, as in solitary, as in set apart. Aunt kept stressing that being set apart was a special thing, a glorious thing, but it only felt like a punishment to me. So I found freedom in playing with the slave children my own age, and freedom in acting out the parts Paris taught me. Sometimes I was a god; sometimes I was a girl (I would be Persephone to his Hades-and we always used the proper Greek names, not the Roman ones of Proserpine and Pluto); sometimes I was an adult. On the stage-in actuality just the courtyard-I could be anyone. In real life, as Aunt kept reminding me, I was the descendant of the divine Augustus and must remember this at all times. But, as Paris informed me, I was also the descendant of his adversary Marc Antony, and Marc Antony was a lot more fun than the stolid and dull divine Augustus.<br><br>"Antony went to the east, to the lands that speak Greek, and to Egypt, and reveled in music, flowers, wine, and the Mysteries of Dionysus. He commanded a great fleet of ships and had a wife named Cleopatra, queen of Egypt. He-"<br><br>"Ruined himself, and disgraced himself as a Roman," cut in a sharp voice. We turned to see Aunt's husband, Silanus, standing in the doorway. It was doubly frightening because he was rarely at home. He stepped over to me, bent down, and looked me in the eyes. "Let Paris tell you the whole story, then. Go on, Paris!" He jerked his head up toward the trembling tutor.<br><br>"Uhh . . . he fought a great sea battle against Augustus, at Actium, and he lost."<br><br>"More than that, he fled back to Egypt, rather than falling on his sword as any self-respecting Roman general should do," finished Silanus. "Before he had defected to the east, he had married Augustus's sister. He left two fine daughters behind, Antonia the Elder and Antonia the Younger. You are descended from both of them. Never forget you are the heir of the Roman Marc Antony, not the debauched and debased Greek one."<br><br>He was so fierce about it I nodded just to get him to look away. Finally he did, standing up and telling Paris to get back to his regular lessons with me, and none of that Greek nonsense.<br><br>After he was safely gone, I said, "But what happened to Marc Antony back in Egypt?"<br><br>"Augustus pursued him there and he died. He is buried in Egypt, not in Rome. Now, Egypt is a very interesting place-there are ancient ruins and huge pyramids-many tombs-and all in all, not a bad place to lie for eternity." He whispered to me, "Antony had other children in Egypt; Augustus brought them back here and raised them as Romans."<br><br>"Did it work? Were they good Romans?"<br><br>"As far as anyone could tell. The girl grew up to be queen of Mauretania, and her son came to Rome later. He would have been your cousin."<br><br>"What happened to him?"<br><br>"Caligula had him executed-because he dared to wear royal purple in the emperor's presence. Now do you see how lucky you were that he only threw you overboard? And that he let someone rescue you? And only laughed about it?"</p><h2>North American Cattle-Ranching Frontiers: Origins, Diffusion and Differentiation (Histories of the American Frontier)</h2><p>This award-winning book offers an invaluable synthesis that is essential reading for anyone interested in the cattle-ranching traditions in North America. In this revisionist study, historical geographer Jordan reinterprets cattle ranching in the Old World and New, challenging the notion that western cattle culture derived principally from Texas. Jordan begins by looking at Old World stock-raising patterns of the British, Spanish, and North Africans and traces how these practices merged in the Caribbean and were brought into Mexico. He also shows how in the eighteenth and nineteenth century cattle-raising found its way to the Eastern Seaboard, the South and Midwest of the present United States, and into California.</p><p>Terry G. Jordan holds the Walter Prescott Webb Chair in Geography at the University of Texas at Austin. He has written numerous books on aspects of historical and cultural geography.Ordinary superlatives seem inadequate to describe this remarkable book. For it is, indeed, as definitive as historical scholarship can be. -- <i>The Journal of Southern History</i><br><br>Teachers and students of frontier and environmental history will find Jordans work an invaluable study. -- <i>Environmental History Review</i></p><h2>Gone Away Lake</h2><p>An enchanting children&#39;s story about an old abandoned town and what the children find there.</p><p>AWARDS &#x2013; GONE AWAY LAKE: <p>� Newbery Honor Book - 1958<br> � New York Herald Tribune's 1957 Children's Spring Book Festival Award<br> � Hans Christian Anderson Award - 1963 - Nominee</p>Elizabeth Enright (1907-1968) was born in Oak Park, Illinois, but spent most of her life in or near New York City.

While Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa engaged in an epic duel for baseball's most coveted individual record -- Roger Maris's 61 home runs, the New York Yankees set new standards for team excellence and established themselves as one of the greatest clubs in the history of the game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Tim McCarver broadcast the climax of each of these extraordinary achievements and is uniquely positioned as a former player, a commentator, and writer to put 1998 into its proper perspective. McCarver is baseball's best analyst and, as he showed with Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans, he is as eloquent and witty on the page as he is behind the microphone. In The Perfect Season, McCarver revels in the homer race and the Yankees but shows that the season contained so much more, ensuring it will stand out as the best there has been. Star players performing to the height of their powers broke records set by true legends of baseball, linking today's players with those who exist somewhere between myth and memory: Ruth and Cobb; Gehrig and Mays. The Perfect Season describes the accomplishments of veterans like Juan Gonzalez, Roger Clemens, Ken Griffey, Jr., Mike Piazza, and Barry Bonds, and of the exceptional young players who hold the future of the game in their hands: Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra, and Kerry Wood. Tim McCarver also laments the passing of some friends and colleagues: Richie Ashburn, Harry Caray, and Dan Quisenberry, and celebrates the careers of some stars who retired after the 1998 season. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Perfect Season is a comprehensive account of 1998 and the perfect souvenir of baseball's greatest year. With it, fans can remember the season in which they got back into the habit of watching the game and reestablished baseball as America's Pastime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of baseball's most outspoken and articulate voices in the booth, Tim McCarver isn't one to mince words in print either. "The year 1998 wasn't just the greatest in baseball history," he states emphatically in <i>The Perfect Season</i>, "it was the greatest any sport has ever enjoyed." Helluva claim. He then proceeds to make a helluva case to back it. <p> Leading off with the obvious, McCarver details how the rousing home-run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and the ghosts of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris was the most visibly rousing thrill, but only one of many thrills in a year that overflowed with spectacular accomplishments. His list is a long one: David Wells's perfect game; Kerry Woods's 20-strikeout masterpiece; Barry Bonds creating the career 400-homer-400-steals club; Craig Biggio becoming the first 50-doubles-50-steals man since Tris Speaker; the end of Cal Ripkin's inconceivable streak; another 50-home-run year from Ken Griffey Jr.; the continuing domination of Roger Clemens; the ascendancy of a trio of marvelous shortstops in Nomar Garciaparra, Derek Jeter, and Alex Rodriguez; the slugging of Mike Piazza; the comeback of Jose Canseco; the Cubs return to post-season play, the 125 Yankee victories, and on and on.</p><p> "It wasn't just that records fell or were equalled at an inordinate rate," insists McCarver, it was the context of the achievements themselves; in 1998, baseball came face to face with marks etched in the books by historically significant names. Thus, 1998 was more than a marvelous season; it was a telescope through which fans could focus on both an exuberant present and a living, vivid past. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Tim McCarver is a baseball analyst for the FOX network and for Yankee games on WNYW in New York.</p><h2>The Art of the Burger: More Than 50 Recipes to Elevate America&#39;s Favorite Meal to Perfection</h2><p><b>The essential book to have on hand before you fire up the grill this summer.</b><br><br>In any city around the world you can find a burger twenty-four hours a day on virtually every corner walk-up, drive-in, sliders, double size, super size, king size, and countless other variations on unimaginative, standardized fast food burgers from under the heat lamp.

Where Jane is tactful and shy, Dolly is flamboyant and unrepentantly selfish, a connoisseur of fine things, an exploiter of wealthy people. But as the exigencies of family bring Jane and Dolly together, Brookner shows us that we may end up loving people we cannot bring ourselves to like -- and that this paradox makes love all the more precious and miraculous.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Anita Brookner has been called &#34;one of the finest novelists of her generation&#34; by The New York Times and &#34;a latter-day Jane Austen&#34; by Publishers Weekly. Now, in Dolly, Brookner continues to explore in her masterful way the changing truths of identity and relationships in the lives of women, with this brilliant portrait of a family. Mild and self-effacing, Jane Manning is ill prepared for the eruption into her life of her glamorous aunt, Dolly. Married to Jane&#39;s uncle, Dolly swirls into the Manning home, and, with her perfumed mink and bored laugh, makes it clear that her ways are not their ways, are not in fact anybody else&#39;s ways. Dolly becomes an object of both fascination and dread, and as Jane studies her aunt, she realizes that she and Dolly have absolutely nothing in common - nothing, except the fact that they are members of the same family. Jane begins to suspect that Dolly is not the woman she appears to be, that her elegant life is not as charming as she wants people to think. Then Dolly&#39;s husband dies, and Jane finds that she and her aunt are fated to be yoked together in uneasy social and financial harness. Brilliantly written, acutely observed, Dolly is Anita Brookner at her best, an elegant and illuminating exploration of how realities change, how power and perceptions alter over the course of a family&#39;s life.Anita Brookner became the first female Slade Professor at Cambridge University in 1968.</p><h2>Yoga Makaranda: The Nectar of Yoga</h2><p>Every epoch goes through myriad changes. Sometimes positive, while at other moments, negative. In conventional Indian thinking, there exists a belief that whenever a dark period dominates, it heralds the time for a shining light to emerge. The beginning of the twentieth century saw such a light in Yogacarya Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. Born at a time when traditional knowledge systems were becoming obsolete, he restored Yoga to its former glory, through his dedication, hard work and creativity. His innovations in the domains of health, healing and spirituality have pioneered the entry of Yoga, once an exclusive practice of the mystics, into every household of our time. A prolific writer, he wrote numerous books and articles on various topics of classical Indian Philosophy. Yoga Makaranda was Krishnamacharya&#39;s first book on the topic of Yoga, published originally in the Kannada language in 1934. This book was one of the very few available at that time, and also the first one to present the practice of Asana-s in a sequential manner (Vinyasa-krama), a method unknown at that time to the general public. It brought a sense of wonder to the people of that generation, and became the main inspiration for many styles of Yoga, that have sustained to the current day. This English version, translated by TKV Desikachar, son and long time pupil of Krishnamacharya, opens the doors to international readers to access some of the earliest teachings of Krishnamacharya. It features ninety nine archival images of the master himself, and some of his students at that time, as well as beautifully illustrated sequences of the postures listed. It also includes expository notes, that provide a profound and erudite understanding of the text.

For here, a tender soul, a vagabond and philosopher, struggles with mortality and meaning&#x2014;in a tale for anyone who has ever feasted on a book...and then had to turn the final page.<br><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>Sam Savage is a native of South Carolina now living in Madison, Wisconsin. He received his bachelor and doctoral degree from Yale University where he taught briefly, and has also worked as a bicycle mechanic, carpenter, commercial fisherman, and letterpress printer. This is his first novel.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>I had always imagined that my life story, if and when I wrote it, would have a great first line: something lyric like Nabokov's "Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins"; or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy's "All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." People remember those words even when they have forgotten everything else about the books. When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the beginning of Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier: "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." I've read that one dozens of times and it still knocks my socks off. Ford Madox Ford was a Big One. <br><br>In all my life struggling to write I have struggled with nothing so manfully&#x2014;yes, that's the word, manfully&#x2014;as with openers. It has always seemed to me that if I could just get that bit right all the rest would follow automatically. I thought of that first sentence as a kind of semantic womb stuffed with the busy embryos of unwritten pages, brilliant little nuggets of genius practically panting to be born. From that grand vessel the entire story would, so to speak, ooze forth. What a delusion! Exactly the opposite was true. And it is not as if there weren't any good ones. Savor this, for example: "When the phone rang at 3:00 a.m. Morris Monk knew even before picking up the receiver that the call was from a dame, and he knew something else too: dames meant trouble." Or this: "Just before being hacked to pieces by Gamel's sadistic soldiers, Colonel Benchley had a vision of the little whitewashed cottage in Shropshire, and Mrs. Benchley in the doorway, and the children." Or this: "Paris, London, Djibouti, all seemed unreal to him now as he sat amid the ruins of yet another Thanksgiving dinner with his mother and father and that idiot Charles." Who can remain unimpressed by sentences like these? They are so pregnant with meaning, so, I dare say, poignant with it that they positively bulge with whole unwritten chapters&#x2014;unwritten, but there, already there! <br>Alas, in reality they were nothing but bubbles, illusions every one. Each of the wonderful phrases, so full of promise, was like a gift-wrapped box clutched in a small child's eager hand, a box that holds nothing but gravel and bits of trash, though it rattles oh so enticingly. He thinks it is candy! I thought it was literature. All those sentences&#x2014;and many, many others as wel&#x2014;proved to be not springboards to the great unwritten novel but insurmountable barriers to it. You see, they were too good. I could never live up to them. Some writers can never equal their first novel. I could never equal my first sentence. And look at me now. Look how I have begun this, my final work, my opus: "I had always imagined that my life story, if and when . . ." Good God, "if and when"! You see the problem. Hopeless. Scratch it.<br>This is the saddest story I have ever heard. It begins, like all true stories, who knows where. Looking for the beginning is like trying to discover the source of a river. You paddle upstream for months under a burning sun, between towering green walls of dripping jungle, soggy maps disintegrating in your hands. You are driven half mad by false hopes, malicious swarms of biting insects, and the tricks of memory, and all you reach at the end&#x2014;the ultima Thule of the whole ridiculous quest&#x2014;is a damp spot in the jungle or, in the case of a story, some perfectly meaningless word or gesture. And yet, at some more or less arbitrary place along the way between the damp spot and the sea the cartographer inserts the point of his compass, and there the Amazon begins. <br><br>It is the same with me, cartographer of the soul, when I look for the beginning of my life story. I close my eyes and stab. I open them and discover a fluttering instant impaled on my compass point: 3:17 p.m. on the thirtieth of April, 1961. I scrunch up my eyes and bring it into focus. Moment, moment on a pin, where's the fellow with no chin? And there I am&#x2014;or, rather, there I was&#x2014;peering cautiously out over the edge of a balcony, just the tip of my nose and one eye. That balcony was a good spot for a looker, a sly peerer like me. From it I could survey the whole shop floor and yet not be seen by any of the people below. That day the store was crowded, more customers than usual for a weekday, and their murmurs floated pleasantly up. It was a beautiful spring afternoon, and some of these people had probably been out for a stroll, thinking about this and that, when their inattention was diverted by a large hand-painted sign in the store window: 30% off all purchases over $20. But I wouldn't really know about that, I mean about what might have attracted them into the store, since I have had no actual experience with the exchange value of money. And indeed the balcony, the store, the customers, even the spring, require explanations, digressions that, however necessary, would wreck the pace of my narrative, which I like to think of as headlong. I have obviously gone too far&#x2014;in my enthusiasm to get the whole thing going I have overshot the mark. We may never know where a story begins, but we sometimes can tell where it cannot begin, where the stream is already in full flood.<br><br>I close my eyes and stab again. I unfold the fluttering instant and pin its wings to the desk: 1:42 a.m., November 9, 1960. It was cold and damp in Boston's Scollay Square, and poor ignorant Flo&#x2014;whom I would know shortly as Mama&#x2014;had taken refuge in the basement of a shop on Cornhill. In her great fright she had somehow contrived to squeeze herself into the far end of a very narrow slot between a large metal cylinder and the concrete wall of the cellar, and she crouched there shaking with fear and cold. She could hear from up on the street level the shouts and laughter drifting away across the Square. They had almost had her that time&#x2014;five men in sailor suits, stamping and kicking and shouting like crazy people. She had been zigzagging this way and that&#x2014;fool them as to your intention, hope they crash into each other&#x2014;when a polished black shoe caught her a blow to the ribs that sent her flying across the sidewalk. <br><br>So how did she escape?<br><br>The way we always escape. By a miracle: the darkness, the rain, a crack in a doorway, a misstep by a pursuer. Pursuit and Escape in America's Oldest Cities. In the scramble of her panic she had managed to get all the way around behind the curved metal thing, so that only a faint glow reached her from the lighted basement, and there she crouched a long time without moving. She closed her eyes against the pain in her side and focused her mind instead on the delicious warmth of the cellar that was rising slowly through her body like a tide. The metal thing was deliciously warm. Its enameled smoothness felt soft, and she pressed her trembling body up against it. Perhaps she slept. Yes, I am sure of it, she slept, and she woke refreshed. <br><br>And then, timid and uncertain, she must have crept from her cave out into the room. A faintly humming fluorescent lamp hanging by a pair of twisted wires from the ceiling cast a flickering bluish light on her surroundings. On her surroundings? What a laugh! On my surroundings! For all around her, everywhere she looked, were books. Floor to ceiling against every wall as well as against both sides of a counter-high partition that ran down the center of the room stood unpainted wooden shelves into which rows of books had been jammed to bursting. Other books, mostly taller volumes, had been wedged in flat on top of these, while still others rose in towering ziggurats from the floor or lay in precarious stacks and sloping piles on top of the partition. This warm musty place where she had found refuge was a mausoleum of books, a museum of forgotten treasures, a cemetery of the unread and unreadable. Old leatherbound tomes, cracked and mildewed, rubbed shoulders with cheap newer books whose yellowing pages had gone brown and brittle at the edges. There were Zane Grey westerns by the saddleload, books of lugubrious sermons by the casketful, old encyclopedias, memoirs of the Great War, diatribes against the New Deal, instruction manuals for the New Woman. But of course Flo did not know that these things were books. Adventures on the Planet Earth. I enjoy picturing her as she peers about at this strange landscape&#x2014;her kind, worn face, her stout body, no, her rotund body, the glittering, hunted eyes, and the cute way she has of wrinkling her nose. Sometimes, just for fun, I put a little blue kerchief on her and knot it at the chin, and then adorable says it all. Mama! <br><br>High in one wall were two small windows. The panes were grimed black with soot and hard to see through, but she could make out that it was still night. She could also hear the quickening pace of the traffic in the street and knew from long habit that another workday was set to begin. The shop above would be opening, perhaps people would be coming down the steep wooden steps into the basement. People down the steps, maybe man-people, big feet, big shoes. Thump. She had to hurry, and&#x2014;let's have this out now&#x2014;not just because she was not keen on being caught by the sailors and kicked again or worse. She had to hurry especially because of the huge thing that was going on inside of her. Well, not a thing exactly, though there were indeed things inside of her (thirteen of them), more like a process, the sort of happening that people, with their enormous sense of humor, call a Blessed Event. A Blessed Event was about to occur, there was no question about it. The only question is, whose blessed event was it? Hers? Or mine? For most of my life I was convinced it had to have been anybody's but mine. But leaving me aside&#x2014;oh, if only I could!&#x2014;and returning to the situation in the basement: there was the Blessed Event on the verge of happening, and the question was what Flo (Mama) was going to do about it. <br><br>Well, I'll tell you what she did about it.&nbsp; <br><br>She went over to the shelf nearest the little cave in back of the warm metal thing and pulled down the biggest book she could get her paws on. She pulled it out and opened it, and holding a page down with her feet she tore it into confetti with her teeth. She did this with a second page, and a third. But here I detect a doubt. How, I hear you asking, do I know that she chose the biggest book? Well, as Jeeves likes to say, it is a question of the psychology of the individual, who in this case is Flo, my impending mother. "Rotund" was, I fear, too kind. She was disgustingly overweight, and just the daily grind of stoking all that fat had made her horribly edgy. Edgy and piggy. Urged on by the voracious clamor of millions of starving cells, she was always sure to grab the biggest slice of anything, even if she was already stuffed to the gills and could only nibble at the edges. Spoiled it for everyone else, of course. So rest assured, the biggest volume around is the one she went for. <br><br>Sometimes I like to think that the first moments of my struggle toward existence were accompanied, as by a triumphal march, by the shredding of Moby-Dick. That would account for the extreme adventurousness of my nature. At other times, when I am feeling particularly outcast and freakish, I am convinced that Don Quixote is the culprit. Just listen to this: "In short, he so immersed himself in those romances that he spent whole days and nights over his books; and thus with little sleeping and much reading, his brains dried up to such a degree that he lost the use of his reason. Having lost his wits completely, he stumbled upon the oddest fancy that had ever entered a madman's brain. He believed that it was necessary, both for his own honor and the service of the state, that he should become a knight-errant." Behold the Knight of Rueful Figure: fatuous, pigheaded, clownish, naive to the point of blindness, idealistic to the point of grotesqueness&#x2014;and who is that if not me in a nutshell? The truth is, I have never been right in the head. Only I don't charge windmills. I do worse: I dream of charging windmills, I long to charge windmills, and sometimes even I imagine I have charged windmills. Windmills or the mills of culture or&#x2014;let's say it&#x2014;those most delectable of all unconquerable objects, those erotic grinders, lascivious little mills of lust, carnal factories of kinky joys, fantasylands of frustrated fornicators, my Lovelies' own bodies. And what difference does it make in the end? A hopeless cause is a hopeless cause. But I won't obsess about that now. I'll obsess about it later. <br><br>Mama had made a huge pile of paper and with great effort was dragging and shoving it back into that little dark cavern she had found. And here we must not allow ourselves to become so distracted by the doleful cacophony of her portly grunts and wheezes as to lose sight of the fundamental question: where did all that paper come from? Whose broken words and shattered sentences did Mama churn into the indecipherable melange that, moments later, would cushion my fall into existence? I am straining my eyes to see. It is very dark in that place where she has pushed the pile and where now she is busy stamping it down in the middle and humping it up at the edges, and I can see it clearly only by leaning over the precipice that is the moment I was born. I am looking down at it from a great height, screwing up my imagination into a kind of telescope. I think I see it. Yes, I recognize it now. Dear Flo has made confetti of Finnegans Wake. Joyce was a Big One, maybe the Biggest One. I was birthed, bedded, and suckled on the defoliated carcass of the world's most unread masterpiece. <br><br>Mine was a large family, and soon thirteen of us were cruddled in its struins, to speak like itself, "chippy young cuppinjars cluttering round, clottering for their creams." (And after all these years, here I am hard at it still&#x2014;clottering, dottering, for my creams, my crumbs. O dreams!) All of us were soon fighting it out over twelve tits: Sweeny, Chucky, Luweena, Feenie, Mutt, Peewee, Shunt, Pudding, Elvis, Elvina, Humphrey, Honeychild, and Firmin (that's me, the thirteenth child). I remember them all so well. They were monsters. Even blind and naked, especially naked, their limbs bulged with sinew and muscle, or so it seemed to me at the time. I alone was born with my eyes wide open and clothed in a modest coat of soft gray fur. I was also puny. And take it from me, being puny is a terrible thing when you are little.</p><h2>Stand Up That Mountain: The Battle to Save One Small Community in the Wilderness Along the Appalachian Trail</h2><p><b>In the tradition of <i>A Civil Action</i>&#x2014;the true story of an outdoorsman living alone in Western North Carolina who teams up with his neighbors and environmental lawyers to save a treasured mountain peak from the mining company.</b><br><br><b>In the tradition of A Civil Ac tion&#x2014;the true story of a North Carolina outdoorsman who teams up with his Appalachian &#x201c;mountain people&#x201d; neighbors to save treasured land from being destroyed</b> <br><br>Living alone in his wooded mountain retreat, Jay Leutze gets a call from a whip-smart fourteen-year-old, Ashley Cook, and her aunt, Ollie Cox, who say a mining company is intent on tearing down Belview Mountain, the towering peak above their house. Ashley and her family, who live in a little spot known locally as Dog Town, are &#x201c;mountain people,&#x201d; with a way of life and speech unique to their home high in the Appalachians. They suspect the mining company is violating the law, and they want Jay, a nonpracticing attorney, to stop the destruction of the mountain. Jay, a devoted naturalist and fisherman, quickly decides to join their cause. <br><br>So begins the epic quest of the &#x201c;Dog Town Bunch,&#x201d; a battle that involves fiery public hearings, clandestine surveillance of the mine operator&#x2019;s activities, ferocious pressure on public officials, and high-stakes legal brinksmanship in the North Carolina court system. Jay helps assemble a talented group of environmental lawyers to do battle with the well-funded attorneys protecting the mining company&#x2019;s plan to dynamite Belview Mountain, which happens to sit next to the famous Appalachian Trail, the 2,184-mile national park that stretches from Maine to Georgia. As the mining company continues to level the forest and erect a gigantic rock-crushing plant on the site, Jay&#x2019;s group searches frantically for a way to stop an act of environmental desecration that will destroy a fragile wild place and mar the Appalachian Trail forever. <br><br>Much more than the record of a legal battle, <i>Stand Up That Mountain </i>takes the reader to a remote corner of Appalachia, a region often stereotyped and little understood, even now in the twenty-first century. A naturally elegant writer, Jay Leutze delivers a powerful, beautifully written story full of remarkable characters, such as &#x201c;Wingfoot,&#x201d; an elusive protector of the Appalachian Trail; a stubborn mining company engineer intent on pulling down the mountain in the face of intense opposition; and Ron Howell, a retired and legendary North Carolina Superior Court judge known as the &#x201c;Heel Hound&#x201d; for his relentless pursuit of legal victory. Jay&#x2019;s plaintiff group is eventually joined by several national conservation groups who see that Belview Mountain and the Appalachian Trail must be protected for future generations of Americans. <br><br>A great contemporary story that demonstrates what is possible when local people set their minds to righting a local wrong, <i>Stand Up That Mountain </i>will appeal to conservationists, hikers, attorneys, and readers fascinated by Appalachia and rural life, and anyone interested in a compelling story both well told and true.</p><p><b>Jay Erskine Leutze </b>was born in Virginia in 1964.&nbsp;He now lives in the Southern Appalachian mountains of North Carolina.&nbsp;Trained as an attorney, he has become a leading voice for state and federal conservation funding for investment in public lands.&nbsp;He is a Trustee for Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy, one of the nation&#x2019;s most established land trusts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chapter 1</b><br> <br>For me, this is how it started. With a phone call.<br> <br>&#x201c;My name is Ashley Cook and I&#x2019;m calling about Paul&#x2019;s crusher.&#x201d; The woman spoke rapidly, as if seizing an opportunity that might pass. &#x201c;I got your name from a lady up on Yellow Mountain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who? Which lady?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beth, I believe it was.&#x201d;<br> <br>Beth Langstaff? My mind tried to find a reference. Witt Langstaff and his wife had bought the pastureland down the hill from me, below my pond. Beth. Must be Witt&#x2019;s wife, I thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is everybody okay? Is Witt okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, not everybody.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s voice was high and tight, like the first string on a guitar. &#x201c;Paul pulled a shot over at the rock crusher and it cracked the foundation on our house. We&#x2019;ve got a police report on it. I called that lady and she called her husband, who is off somewhere working, and that man said I should call you, because Paul has run all over the mountain, and you being a lawyer . . .&#x201d; She stopped to regroup. &#x201c;See, Paul and Richard Whitehead&#x2014;you probably know him&#x2014;and James Vance, we call him Nasty, they work for Paul, and he has violated the mining law in ten different ways. At least ten. I haven&#x2019;t counted it up, not yet. Now they want to put in a gravel conveyor that would be on a seventy-nine-foot tower.&#x201d; Ashley Cook&#x2019;s words came out in a torrent, but her tone was clear and her intelligence obvious. Her accent was faint, country, but not overtly <i>mountain</i>, and I wondered if she was making an effort to conceal it. She said she was a Cook. I knew the Cooks from up on Little Horse Creek, but she didn&#x2019;t talk quite like them. She sounded as if she had moved away from here and come back, had tried to forget how to talk mountain.<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard it,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Heard what?&#x201d; She&#x2019;d gotten tangled up in her own telling.<br> <br>&#x201c;When they pulled that shot. When they blew that first chunk out of the mountain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you live up on Birchfield Creek somewhere?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I live up on the mountain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you heard it all the way up there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s interesting,&#x201d; she said, as if this were an important part of a puzzle she was piecing together. Now she muffled the receiver and relayed my words to some audience: &#x201c;He says he heard that shot all the way up on Yellow Mountain!&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes, I had heard it. I was working at my desk when the air went wild with an explosion on Belview Mountain. The sound swept up the east slope of Big Yellow and screamed over the house. I sat up. Nearly levitated. One of the dogs, Biscuit, rose from a deep sleep and let loose a fusillade of barks. I expected every tree on the ridge to lie over flat, for feathers to fly from birds, but once the sound passed, everything stood as it had.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me about the gravel conveyor,&#x201d; I said. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to make of any of this just yet, but this woman had seized my attention.<br> <br>She paused. I detected in her tone that she was less than impressed that I did not immediately understand the significance of a seventy-nine-foot conveyor tower.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want to talk to Aunt Ollie?&#x201d; she asked suddenly.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know if I did or not. In my brief moment of consideration, the phone was passed on to Aunt Ollie.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope we&#x2019;re not a-botherin&#x2019; you,&#x201d; said a new voice, &#x201c;but, son, we got big trouble, Mr.&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call me Jay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right, Mr. Jay. We need help. We&#x2019;re killed.&#x201d;<br> <br>This voice I knew. The Cooks have been rooted in Avery County for as long as history or memory records. They are mountain people. Hard people with birdy faces who live high up on the cold creeks. Either hard drinking or hard churchgoing, the Cooks and Taylors I knew growing up were wraithlike. They grew potatoes and a little bit of corn, cabbage. They hacked at the slopes to try to get the earth to give something back. Some of them carpentered for a living, others worked horses, in timber, and one of them was married to a man who ran a sawmill down below our house when I was a boy. They talked in the singsong trill of the deep hollers. I asked Aunt Ollie how she was kin to my neighbor Stella Thomas, who was born a Cook.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my sister. My half sister. See, my father got married twicet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I had heard that before.<br> <br>Aunt Ollie took a deep breath. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in trouble,&#x201d; she said before pausing. Was she smoking? She might have paused to pull on a cigarette. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re barely hanging on. Paul&#x2019;s killing us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right. But who is Paul?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Jesus, son!&#x201d; she exclaimed at my lack of knowledge. &#x201c;Paul owns that rock crusher over across from my house. He&#x2019;s killing us. You don&#x2019;t know Paul Brown?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Paul Brown,&#x201d; I said, scrambling to repair my credibility. &#x201c;Clark Stone Company. I know of him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re going to know Paul real good before this thing is over. Because he&#x2019;s going to pull that whole mountain down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So I hear. What can I do for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What we need for you to do, if you&#x2019;ll do it, is to come to the county-commissioner meeting. I don&#x2019;t know if we need a lawyer, or a preacher, or a damn undertaker, but Sam Laws has got this thing all lined up the way he wants it. Thing is, doesn&#x2019;t Avery County have a Ridge Law?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;North Carolina has a Ridge Law,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about the county.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if I&#x2019;d knowed what to do, I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve already done it.&#x201d; She nearly said <i>I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve already did it,</i> but she corrected herself. I made a note of her efforts in this regard. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t get a lawyer because Paul has them all bought off already. He&#x2019;s got a lawyer on a retainer, that&#x2019;s what I heard. Ashley, she&#x2019;s read everything on the books, but Paul don&#x2019;t care one thing about any laws, and he&#x2019;s wanting to get a variance for his conveyor tower and hit seventy-nine feet tall. And the commissioners are all a bunch of damn dogs, some of them anyway. You might know some of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is Ashley?&#x201d; I asked, treading furiously to keep up.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s who you were just talking to. Ashley Cook. She&#x2019;s read everything in print and on the Internet, too. All the mining laws they ever passed. She&#x2019;s my niece.&#x201d;<br> <br>I heard a question raised from beyond her. A son? Husband? Aunt Ollie now relayed the question. &#x201c;Dallas says, don&#x2019;t a seventy-nine-foot conveyor violate the Ridge Law? We&#x2019;re killed if it don&#x2019;t. <i>Hayull.</i>&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It might.&#x201d;<br> <br>She drew in her breath again. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m honest I don&#x2019;t know what to do. You got to forgive me. I got your name and I told Dallas, that&#x2019;s my husband&#x2014;everybody calls him Curly on account of his hair, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve heard of him&#x2014;and he said we had to call somebody to do something about this, because Paul, he&#x2019;s coming in here like a Scud missile. And luckily Ashley, she got your name.&#x201d; Aunt Ollie felt the need to explain, for which I was grateful. &#x201c;Well, what happened was, Dallas asked a man, and he said to call Witt Langstaff from up on Yellow Mountain &#x2019;cause he&#x2019;s madder&#x2019;n hell about Paul. And his wife, Mrs. Langstaff, she said she would have to call him where he was a-workin&#x2019;, and then she called me back and she give me your number. Can you help us?&#x201d;</p><h2>Gnostic Discoveries, The: The Impact of the Nag Hammadi Library</h2><p><p>The Meaning of the Nag Hammadi, now in paperback opens the with the thrilling adventure story of the discovery of the ancient Papyrii at Nag Hammadi. Muhammad Ali, the fellahin, discovered the sealed jar, he feared that it might contain a jinni, or spirit, but also had heard of hidden treasures in such jars. Greed overcame his fears and when he smashed open the jar, gold seemed to float into the air. To his disappointment, it was papyrus fragmenst, not gold, but for scholars around the world, it was invaluable.</p> <p>Meyer then discusses the pre�Christian forms of wisdom that went onto influence what Christians believe today. In addition, some Nag Hammadi texts are attributed to Valentinus, a man who almost became Pope, and whose rejection changed the church in significant ways. Text by text, Meyer traces the history and impact of this great find on the Church, right up to our current beliefs and popular cultural fascination with this officially suppressed secret knowledge about Jesus and his followers.</p></p><p><p>Marvin Meyer is one of the <em>foremost</em> scholars on early Christianity and texts about Jesus outside the New Testament. He is Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California. Among his recent books are <em>The Gospel of Judas</em>, <em>The Gnostic Gospels of Jesus</em>, <em>The Gospels of Mary</em>, <em>The Gospel of Thomas</em>, and <em>The Nag Hammadi Scriptures</em>.</p>Before the discovery of the Nag Hammadi documents in the 1940s, Gnosticism was considered to be a form of anti-Christian heresy taught by some early church fathers and condemned by others. Modern readers depended on secondary works condemning Gnosticism in order to understand its proponents' point of view. But with the unearthing of the Gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi, scholars have a better idea of the scope and direction of Gnostic teaching in the early years of Christianity as told by its adherents. Meyer, professor of Bible and Christian studies at Chapman University in California, boasts nine previous publications on the subject and demonstrates a deep understanding of both the history and content of the documents. After briefly recounting their discovery, he analyzes their content, sorting through the teachings and relating them, not just to the biblical text, but even to the bestselling novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. Although there is no new material, the author's concise presentation will appeal to many readers. Meyer writes clearly, bringing both the people and the times of the early Gnostic writings to life and making them accessible to scholar and layperson alike. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are no bodies. No such plane has ever been reported missing, but men both good and evil have been seeking it for a long, long time. Hidden in the plane is a list of names, a record of those who have struck a deal with the Devil. Now a battle is about to commence between those who want the list to remain secret and those who believe that it represents a crucial weapon in the struggle against the forces of darkness. The race to secure the prize draws in private detective Charlie Parker, a man who knows more than most about the nature of the terrible evil that seeks to impose itself on the world, and who fears that his own name may be on the list. It lures others too. But as the rival forces descend upon this northern state, the woods prepare to meet them, for the forest depths hide other secrets. Someone has survived the crash.

The old man&#x2019;s long gray hair was splayed against the pillow on which he lay, glazed by the lamplight, so that it seemed like the emanations of his departing spirit. His breathing was shallow; longer and longer were the pauses between each intake and exhalation, and soon they would cease entirely. The evening gloaming was slowly descending, but the trees were still visible through the bedroom window, the sentinels of the Great North Woods, for old Harlan had always said that he lived at the very edge of the frontier, that his home was the last place before the forest held sway.<br> <br>It seemed to him now that, as his strength failed him, so too his power to keep nature at bay was ebbing. There were weeds in his yard, and brambles among his rosebushes. The grass was patchy and unkempt; it needed one final mow before the coming of winter, just as the stubble on his own chin rasped uncomfortably against his fingers, for the girl could not shave him as well as he had once shaved himself. Fallen leaves lay uncollected like the flakes of dry skin that peeled from his hands and his face, scattering themselves upon his sheets. He saw decline through his window, and decline in his mirror, but in only one was there the promise of rebirth.<br> <br>The girl claimed that she had enough to do without worrying about bushes and trees, and the boy was still too angry to perform even this simple service for his dying father, but to Harlan these things were important. There was a battle to be fought, an ongoing war against nature&#x2019;s attritional impulse. If everyone thought as his daughter did, houses would be overrun by root and ivy, and towns would vanish beneath seas of brown and green. A man had only to open his eyes in this county to see the ruins of old dwellings suffocated in green, or open his ears to hear the names of settlements that no longer existed, lost somewhere in the depths of the forest.<br> <br>So nature needed to be held back, and the trees had to be kept to their domain.<br> <br>The trees, and what dwelled among them.<br> <br>Harlan was not a particularly religious man, and had always poured scorn on those whom he termed &#x201c;God-botherers&#x201d;&#x2014;Christian, Jew, or Muslim, he had no time for any of them&#x2014;but he was, in his way, a deeply spiritual being, worshipping a god whose name was whispered by leaves and praised in birdsong. He had been a warden with the Maine Forest Service for forty years, and even after his retirement his knowledge and expertise had often been sought by his successors, for few knew these woods as well as he. It was Harlan who had found twelve-year-old Barney Shore after the boy&#x2019;s father collapsed while hunting, his heart exploding so quickly in his chest that he was dead within seconds of hitting the ground. The boy, in shock and unused to the woods, had wandered north, and when the snow began to descend he had hidden himself beneath a fallen tree, and would surely have died there had Harlan not been following his tracks, so that the boy heard the old man calling his name just as the snow covered the traces of his passing.<br> <br>It was to Harlan, and to Harlan alone, that Barney Shore told the tale of the girl in the woods, a girl with sunken eyes, and wearing a black dress, who had come to him with the first touch of snow, inviting him to follow her deeper into the woods, calling on him to play with her in the northern darkness.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I hid from her, and I didn&#x2019;t go with her,&#x201d; Barney told Harlan, as the old man carried him south upon his back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not, son?&#x201d; said Harlan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because she wasn&#x2019;t a little girl, not really. She just looked like one. I think she was very old. I think she&#x2019;d been there for a long, long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Harlan had nodded and said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; for he had heard tales of the lost girl in the woods, although he had never seen her himself, unless bad dreams counted, and he prayed to his god of air and tree and leaf that he might be spared the sight of her. There was a time, though, when he had felt her presence, and he had known as he was searching for the boy that he was once again drawing close to her territory.<br> <br>He shuddered and thought carefully before he spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I were you, son, I wouldn&#x2019;t mention the girl to anyone else,&#x201d; he said at last, and he felt the boy nod against him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t believe me anyway, would they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I reckon they&#x2019;d think you were suffering from shock and exposure, and they&#x2019;d put it down to that, most of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you believe me, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes, I believe you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She was real, wasn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s the word I&#x2019;d use for her. I don&#x2019;t reckon that you could touch her or smell her or feel her breath upon your face. I don&#x2019;t know that you could see her footprints indented in the snow, or discern the stain of sap and leaf upon her skin. But if you&#x2019;d followed her like she asked I&#x2019;d never have found you, and I&#x2019;m certain that nobody else would ever have found you either, alive or dead. You did well to keep away from her. You&#x2019;re a good boy, a brave boy. Your daddy would be proud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Against his back began the convulsions of the boy&#x2019;s sobs. It was the first time he had cried since Harlan discovered him. Good, thought Harlan. The longer it takes for the tears to come, the worse the pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you find my daddy too?&#x201d; said the boy. &#x201c;Will you bring him home? I don&#x2019;t want him to stay in the woods. I don&#x2019;t want the girl to have him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Harlan. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find him, and you can say goodbye to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>And he did.<br> <br>Harlan was already in his seventies by then, and had a few more years left in him, but he was no longer the man he once had been, even though he, and he alone, had found Barney Shore. Age was part of it, that was for sure, but so too were the losses he had endured. His wife, Angeline, had been taken from him by a cruel alliance of Parkinson&#x2019;s and Alzheimer&#x2019;s one year before Barney Shore spoke to him of predatory girls. He had loved her as much as a man can love his wife, and so nothing more need be said.<br> <br>The loss of his wife was the second such blow that Harlan would receive in less than a year. Shortly after she passed away, Paul Scollay, Harlan&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had sat on a bucket in the little woodshed at the back of his cabin, put his shotgun in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. The cancer had been nibbling at him for a while, and now had got a taste for him. He put an end to its feeding, as he had always told his friend that he would. They had shared a drink earlier in the day&#x2014;just a beer or two at the pine table beside that very woodshed with the sun setting behind the trees, as beautiful an evening as Harlan had seen in many a year. They had reminisced some, and Paul had seemed relaxed and at peace with himself, which was how Harlan had known that the end was near. He did not remark upon it, though. They had simply shaken hands and Harlan had said that he would see Paul around, and Paul had replied, &#x201c;Ayuh. I guess so,&#x201d; and that was the end of it.<br> <br>And though they spoke of many things in those final hours, there was one subject upon which they did not touch, one memory that was not disinterred. They had agreed years before that they would not talk of it unless absolutely necessary, but it hung between them in the last of their time together as the sun bathed them in its radiance, like the promise of forgiveness from a god in whom neither of them believed.<br> <br>And so it was that at the time of his dying, at the day and the hour of it, Harlan Vetters summoned his son and his daughter to his bedside, the woods waiting beyond, the god of tree and leaf moving through them, coming at last to claim the old man, and he said to them:<br> <br>&#x201c;Once upon a time, Paul Scollay and I found an airplane in the Great North Woods.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#x201d;</p><h2>India: A Travel Survival Kit (Lonely Planet India)</h2><p>Book by &#39;Geoff Crowther, etc.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>Are All the Giants Dead</h2><p>Finding himself in a land peopled with fairy tale characters, James attempts to help Princess Dulcibel who is destined to marry a toad after her ball falls in the well.</p><p><p>Mary Norton (1903-1992) lived in England, where she was an actress, playwright, and award-winning author of the classic Borrowers novels.</p></p><h2>Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive</h2><p>Henry Hazlitt strongly recommended this book for all students of the social sciences. It had a formative influence on his life. In fact, it is the book that taught him how to think.And not only Hazlitt. William Stanley Jevons&#39;s book was the seminal contribution that educated many generations of English and American scholars that crucial discipline of logic. It teaches the rules for thinking. Now, this was a subject that every student once had to take, and not in college but quite early in life, and certainly by high school.No more. Today, it is widely assumed that there is no structure of thinking that is worth studying. And perhaps that explains why serious thinking is so rare. It is nothing short of astonishing that most people go all the way through school with no exposure to logic at all.We&#39;ve long looked for a good text to bring into print. Jevons, one of the architects of the Marginal Revolution, is a great choice.To be sure, this book is not easy. It takes patience and discipline. It offers a great challenge to anyone. However, if you can go through the book and learn from it, you will have a massive advantage over colleagues, most of whom have never studied this area.Does it make sense that an economics publishers would bring out a book on logic? Certainly it does from a Misesian point of view. Logic is the method of economic thinking. Without it, indeed, economic theory is not possible.May Jevons school the current generation in the way he did so many previous ones.</p><p></p><h2>A Mind Awake: An Anthology of C.S.

The dolls seem almost able to communicate with her, and indeed they do talk and walk among themselves when humans are asleep. While Melissa is recovering, her cousin Valerie comes from South Carolina to visit. The Southern family suffered greatly in the Civil War, and is about to lose their plantation to carpetbaggers; only the discovery of a lost family treasure can save them. The dolls, with the help of a small wooden newcomer who knows a bit about voodoo, guide Melissa to the clue that leads to buried gold. Stover captures, in a readable style, the ambiance of a warm, 19th-century family story, and she introduces at the same time an element of fantasy. The dolls' own lives mesh smoothly with the imaginary world the girls create for them, and their interaction with Melissa is believable. The somewhat prickly relationship between the two cousins is well handled, as is Melissa's coming to terms with the lameness with which she must learn to live.

More recently he has produced television documentaries, including one that was the genesis of this book. He lives in Jerusalem.In 1958, an American U-2 spy plane flying over Israel spotted an unusual construction site near the small Negev Desert town of Dimona. The facility featured a long perimeter fence, building activity and several roads. Israeli officials initially called the facility a textile plant; they later changed their minds and described it as a "metallurgical research installation." In September 1960, according to Israeli accounts, the United States got a better look at Dimona from a Corona reconnaissance satellite. By December, CIA Director Allen Dulles felt sure enough of what was going on to tell President Eisenhower that Israel was secretly constructing a nuclear reactor that would allow it to build the bomb. Israel has never admitted that it has nuclear weapons, though it does not deny having them. As the Israeli journalist Michael Karpin suggests in his aptly titled The Bomb in the Basement, the United States has gone along with this charade because acknowledging the existence of Israel's nuclear arsenal would incite futile demands by Arabs and Iranians to get rid of it. Still, this worldly winking rankles at a time when the United States and Israel are leading the charge to make Iran, North Korea and other threatening actors come clean about their own nuclear activities. Many developing countries resist the idea of holding Iran to account for breaking nonproliferation rules when Israel is given a pass. But there's another way to think of the issue. Rather than pretend that Israel's nuclear posture is irrelevant, perhaps it's time to use Israel's muted approach to its atomic arsenal as an example for the United States, Russia and other nuclear powers to follow. Unlike its adversaries, Israel has a deep-rooted democratic government and does not threaten the existence of other states. It also has an obvious goad; David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, began the Jewish state's nuclear quest in the 1950s with harrowing images of Dachau and Belsen still fresh in his mind. For him, the bomb was the ultimate guarantor of "never again." In scale and expense, however, a nuclear-arms program seemed out of reach for a tiny, poor and often friendless nation. Ben-Gurion and a handful of technical optimists quietly trained scientists, imported nuclear technology and solicited the aid of France. French cooperation was less a matter of state policy than of the determination of key individuals within the French nuclear establishment -- many of them non-Jews -- to rectify Vichy France's complicity in the Holocaust. President Charles de Gaulle twice ordered a stop to French assistance between 1958 and 1960, but key nuclear officials ignored him. Finally a deal was struck: The French government would cease construction work on the Dimona reactor, but contracts with private French companies would remain in force. Meanwhile, President John F. Kennedy leaned hard on Ben-Gurion and his successor, Levi Eshkol, not to build the bomb, even sending U.S. inspectors into Israel's Dimona reactor starting in 1961. But Israeli nuclear leaders outfoxed the inspectors, and Washington's resolve faded with Kennedy's death. By Nov. 1966, Israel had the capability to detonate a nuclear device. Karpin tells this intriguing story through pithy accounts of the major events and profiles of the key actors, with the scene shifting from Israel to France to Egypt to Washington. His rendition is more entertaining than Avner Cohen's seminal Israel and the Bomb (1998), even if it's less cogent concerning the implications of the Israeli atomic project. As Cohen pointed out, something about the bomb invites opacity -- not only to keep foreign adversaries from mobilizing but also to keep one's own citizens from raising questions. Even among themselves, Israeli leaders did not refer to building nuclear weapons but to "Dimona," "it" and "the big thing." One of Kennedy's advisers called it "the delicate matter." As would happen in India, another democracy aspiring to get nuclear arms, many key decisions and activities went unrecorded. Costs were neither tallied nor debated seriously. Iran is probably doing much the same thing now. Ironies abound here for today's reader. Shimon Peres, who is now sometimes ridiculed for dovish flights of fancy, was the hard-driving CEO of the bomb project. Lyndon B. Johnson, a member of the Disciples of Christ, blessed the enterprise at least in part out of biblical appreciation of the covenant between God and the children of Israel. Karpin writes that Johnson was influenced by an inscription his grandfather wrote in the family photo album: "Take care of the Jews, God's chosen people ... help them any way you can." As it did in other countries, the Israeli pursuit of the bomb assumed sacred dimensions. "In Ben-Gurion's eyes," Karpin writes, "the nuclear project was holy." Those who donated to it were "consecrators," helping to build the Holy of Holies for modern Israel. According to Karpin, from 1958-60, the American businessman Abraham Feinberg led a secret fundraising campaign for the nuclear project that garnered about $40 million ($250 million in today's terms) from "some twenty-five millionaires." Karpin describes in new detail how Edward Teller, the monomaniacal father of the H-bomb, visited Israel six times between 1964 and 1967 -- the period when Israel passed the atomic threshold -- and unabashedly urged his friends there to build the bomb. All the while, Teller's government was negotiating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Israel has never signed. Karpin intimates that Teller assisted Israel in designing sophisticated nuclear weapons. For the many people who want to equate Iran or Pakistan's nuclear aspirations with Israel's, the cooperation of Teller and French scientists and engineers with Israel will invite defensive equation with the notorious A.Q. Khan network, which helped spread bomb designs and know-how from Pakistan to Libya and Iran. Meanwhile, the CIA and other agencies missed telltale signs of what Israel was up to. In 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, Teller told a key CIA official that Israel probably had the bomb; the CIA relayed this information to President Johnson, but the secretaries of defense and state were kept out of the loop. Karpin also argues that domestic politics influenced the management of intelligence and nonproliferation policy. For instance, he shows how Yitzhak Rabin, then Israel's ambassador to Washington, angrily outflanked Pentagon and State Department negotiators who insisted in 1968 that U.S. sales of Phantom fighter jets to Israel be conditioned on Israel's signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and allowing American inspectors to visit every site in Israel associated with strategic weapons. Rabin "got Abe Feinberg and Arthur Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to go and talk to Johnson." In another channel, Rabin "peppered the heads of the Democratic Party with messages to the effect that it was worth their while before the [1968] elections to present the Jewish voter with a show of support for Israel." Defense Secretary Clark Clifford and Secretary of State Dean Rusk did not know that Israel already had the bomb and that Feinberg and Goldberg already had the president. Interesting as all this is, some flaws lurk in The Bomb in the Basement. Karpin badly botches his description of how nuclear bombs work. The difficulty of controlling nuclear reactions does not arise because "the uranium-235 and the plutonium isotopes are very sensitive to movement." "A simple bomb" does not consist "of a container holding two pellets of fissile material that are pressed together by two springs and separated by a wedge." Nor does Karpin prove his claim that, "if the Eisenhower administration had proposed that Israel swap Dimona for a security alliance, there can be no doubt that Israel would have happily accepted." (Israel might well have preferred its own nukes to promises from Eisenhower and his anti-Israel State Department.) Most important, Karpin is so enthralled with the Israeli nuclear project that he avoids exploring its ramifications. He doesn't ask how or whether nuclear weapons can be confined only to the "good guys" and kept forever away from the "bad guys." Even so, this is a worthwhile book, and it arrives when new thinking is needed about the global nuclear order. Here's one heretical suggestion: Israel's restrained management of its bomb could actually point the way toward abating global nuclear dangers. After all, Israel has never claimed to possess nuclear weapons and has never used them to enhance its prestige or browbeat its neighbors. For Israel, the bomb has never been something to brandish, never a shield behind which to hide while it annexes territory or undermines domestic or regional rivals -- as was feared the bomb would be for Saddam Hussein's Iraq and, perhaps, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's Iran. It is a shield against annihilation. Today the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China, France, India and Pakistan are known to possess atomic arsenals. By treaty or declaration, these countries are formally committed to pursuing nuclear disarmament. But much of the world feels that, because these declared nuclear-armed powers refuse to take this objective seriously, they have no right to enforce nonproliferation rules on other countries. One way the Nuclear Eight could begin to show they are serious about disarmament would be to follow Israel's example and lower the salience of their weapons -- putting them at the bottom of their national arsenals, refraining from pointing to them during crises and declining to pull international rank because of them. Since such forbearance has not threatened the small, beleaguered Jewish state's security, the United States, Russia, Pakistan, France and, increasingly, China have no excuse for relying as prominently as they do on nuclear arsenals. Karpin stops short of offering this implication, but the world might be a bit safer if all the nuclear powers put their bombs in the basement.

Women Who Kept the Lights details the careers of 30 intrepid women who were official keepers of light stations on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts, on Lake Champlain and the Great Lakes, staying at their posts for periods ranging from a few years to half a century. Most of these women served in the 19th century, when the keeper lit a number of lamps in the tower at dusk, replenished their fuel or replaced them at midnight, and every morning polished the lamps and lanterns to keep their lights shining brightly.<br><br>Several of these stalwart women were commended for their courage in remaining at their posts through severe storms and hurricanes. A few went to the rescue of seamen when ships capsized or were wrecked. Their varied stories are brought together here for the first time, drawing a multifaceted picture of a unique profession in our maritime history.</p><p>Danger and loneliness were common themes in the lives of women lighthouse keepers in the United States from 1776 to the mid-20th century. Most were appointed to succeed a deceased husband or father, and most appear to have borne the risks with fortitude and outright heroism. While the challenges and duties these women faced were similar, the authors have captured the uniqueness of each woman's experience. They compensate for the scanty biographical record with detailed descriptions of the lighthouses and keeper's quarters. The style is documentary, carried by the charm of each keeper's own story. Of 170 pages of text, 72 pages include illustrations (not seen).

In Never Cry Wolf conservationist Farley Mowat sets out to correct the stereotypes. Using his observations of a Canadian wolf pack, Mowat paints a sensitive picture of the wolf as a mild-tempered and graceful animal with strong familial bonds and a taste for small prey rather than livestock. Whilst the scientific basis of some of Mowats conclusions has been contested, this affectionate and humorous account provides an intimate understanding of wolf behaviour, and has provoked readers to fight for the preservation of these majestic creatures. This fascinating study marked a watershed in attitudes, proving that the wolf bears little resemblance to the gluttonous villain of children&#39;s fairy tales or to the Gothic werewolf.</p><p></p><h2>Collected Stories of Lydia Davis</h2><p>The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis is the complete collection of short fiction from the world-renowned Lydia Davis. WINNER OF THE MAN BOOKER INTERNATIONAL PRIZE 2013 &#39;Big rejoicing: Lydia Davis has won the Man Booker International prize. Never did a book award deliver such a true match-winning punch. Best of all, a new audience will read her now and find her wit, her vigour and rigour, her funniness, her thoughtfulness, and the precision of form, which mark Davis out as unique. Daring, excitingly intelligent and often wildly comic [she] reminds you, in a world that likes to bandy its words about, what words such as economy, precision and originality really mean. This is a writer as mighty as Kafka, as subtle as Flaubert and as epoch-making, in her own way, as Proust. A two-liner from Davis, or a seemingly throwaway paragraph, will haunt. What looks like a game will open to deep seriousness; what looks like philosophy will reveal playfulness, tragicomedy, ordinariness; what looks like ordinariness will ask you to look again at Davis&#39;s writing. In its acuteness, it always asks attentiveness, and it repays this by opening up to its reader like possibility, or like a bush covered in flowerheads. She&#39;s a joy. There&#39;s no writer quite like her&#39; Ali Smith &#39;What stories. Precise and piercing, extremely funny.

She won the Man Booker International Prize in 2013.THE COLLECTED STORIES OF LYDIA DAVIS &nbsp; Story <p>I get home from work and there is a message from him: that he is not coming, that he is busy. He will call again. I wait to hear from him, then at nine o&#x2019;clock I go to where he lives, find his car, but he&#x2019;s not home. I knock at his apartment door and then at all the garage doors, not knowing which garage door is his&#x2014;no answer. I write a note, read it over, write a new note, and stick it in his door. At home I am restless, and all I can do, though I have a lot to do, since I&#x2019;m going on a trip in the morning, is play the piano. I call again at ten forty-five and he&#x2019;s home, he has been to the movies with his old girlfriend, and she&#x2019;s still there. He says he&#x2019;ll call back. I wait. Finally I sit down and write in my notebook that when he calls me either he will then come to me, or he will not and I will be angry, and so I will have either him or my own anger, and this might be all right, since anger is always a great comfort, as I found with my husband. And then I go on to write, in the third person and the past tense, that clearly she always needed to have a love even if it was a complicated love. He calls back before I have time to finish writing all this down. When he calls, it is a little after eleven thirty. We argue until nearly twelve. Everything he says is a contradiction: for example, he says he did not want to see me because he wanted to work and even more because he wanted to be alone, but he has not worked and he has not been alone. There is no way I can get him to reconcile any of his contradictions, and when this conversation begins to sound too much like many I had with my husband I say goodbye and hang up. I finish writing down what I started to write down even though by now it no longer seems true that anger is any great comfort.</p> <p>I call him back five minutes later to tell him that I am sorry about all this arguing, and that I love him, but there is no answer. I call again five minutes later, thinking he might have walked out to his garage and walked back, but again there is no answer. I think of driving to where he lives again and looking for his garage to see if he is in there working, because he keeps his desk there and his books and that is where he goes to read and write. I am in my nightgown, it is after twelve and I have to leave the next morning at five. Even so, I get dressed and drive the mile or so to his place. I am afraid that when I get there I will see other cars by his house that I did not see earlier and that one of them will belong to his old girlfriend. When I drive down the driveway I see two cars that weren&#x2019;t there before, and one of them is parked as close as possible to his door, and I think that she is there. I walk around the small building to the back where his apartment is, and look in the window: the light is on, but I can&#x2019;t see anything clearly because of the half-closed venetian blinds and the steam on the glass. But things inside the room are not the same as they were earlier in the evening, and before there was no steam. I open the outer screen door and knock. I wait. No answer. I let the screen door fall shut and I walk away to check the row of garages. Now the door opens behind me as I am walking away and he comes out. I can&#x2019;t see him very well because it is dark in the narrow lane beside his door and he is wearing dark clothes and whatever light there is is behind him. He comes up to me and puts his arms around me without speaking, and I think he is not speaking not because he is feeling so much but because he is preparing what he will say. He lets go of me and walks around me and ahead of me out to where the cars are parked by the garage doors.</p> <p>As we walk out there he says &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; and my name, and I am waiting for him to say that she is here and also that it&#x2019;s all over between us. But he doesn&#x2019;t, and I have the feeling he did intend to say something like that, at least say that she was here, and that he then thought better of it for some reason. Instead, he says that everything that went wrong tonight was his fault and he&#x2019;s sorry. He stands with his back against a garage door and his face in the light and I stand in front of him with my back to the light. At one point he hugs me so suddenly that the fire of my cigarette crumbles against the garage door behind him. I know why we&#x2019;re out here and not in his room, but I don&#x2019;t ask him until everything is all right between us. Then he says, &#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t here when I called you. She came back later.&#x201d; He says the only reason she is there is that something is troubling her and he is the only one she can talk to about it. Then he says, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand, do you?&#x201d;</p> <p>I try to figure it out.</p> <p>So they went to the movies and then came back to his place and then I called and then she left and he called back and we argued and then I called back twice but he had gone out to get a beer (he says) and then I drove over and in the meantime he had returned from buying beer and she had also come back and she was in his room so we talked by the garage doors. But what is the truth? Could he and she both really have come back in that short interval between my last phone call and my arrival at his place? Or is the truth really that during his call to me she waited outside or in his garage or in her car and that he then brought her in again, and that when the phone rang with my second and third calls he let it ring without answering, because he was fed up with me and with arguing? Or is the truth that she did leave and did come back later but that he remained and let the phone ring without answering? Or did he perhaps bring her in and then go out for the beer while she waited there and listened to the phone ring? The last is the least likely. I don&#x2019;t believe anyway that there was any trip out for beer.</p> <p>The fact that he does not tell me the truth all the time makes me not sure of his truth at certain times, and then I work to figure out for myself if what he is telling me is the truth or not, and sometimes I can figure out that it&#x2019;s not the truth and sometimes I don&#x2019;t know and never know, and sometimes just because he says it to me over and over again I am convinced it is the truth because I don&#x2019;t believe he would repeat a lie so often. Maybe the truth does not matter, but I want to know it if only so that I can come to some conclusions about such questions as: whether he is angry at me or not; if he is, then how angry; whether he still loves her or not; if he does, then how much; whether he loves me or not; how much; how capable he is of deceiving me in the act and after the act in the telling.</p> <p>THE COLLECTED STORIES OF LYDIA DAVIS Copyright � 2009 by Lydia Davis</p></p><h2>The Catwalk Cats</h2><p>For more than 20 years, the fashion powerhouses Grace Coddington and Didier Malige have lived together with a menagerie of incorrigible cats. This delightful, giftworthy book records their relationship through photographs (Malige's) and drawings (Coddington's) that document the couple's highly entertaining private and work lives through the eyes of their feline friends. These include Henri, an old-school, catnip-addicted, surfing chartreuse; his sister Coco, a couture-obsessed chartreuse on a sashimi diet; and her pal Baby, who doesn't quite share Coco's discipline, and will, sadly, never fit into a sample size. Then there's Puff, a mixed-up long-hair from Harlem whose curiosity--anyone for fortune-telling at Dave?--hasn't killed him yet; and finally Bart, the Persian youngster who would rather sit on the rooftop terrace than in the front row. <i>The Catwalk Cats</i>, a visual diary introduced by the irrepressible Puff, gives us a window into four madcap seasons in the life of this fabulous furry brigade, with sections devoted to the Collections, the Campaigns, and, of course, the Catfights. At once delightful and dishy, it is both a convincing argument for the fundamental similarities between felines and fashionistas and a moving meditation on love and life as a family.</p><p></p><h2>Down Among the Dead Men</h2><p>In the sequel to Blue Moon Rising, the Rangers are sent to investigate a mysterious breakdown in communications with a border fortress and are forced into an alliance with outlaws against an ancient, evil beast that threatens the entire world.

Roth&#x2019;s questions go to the original conditions that stimulate the narrative impulse, and he puts them to writers who are as attuned to the subtleties of literature as to the influence of the surrounding society.<br> Also included here are appreciative portraits of two of Roth&#x2019;s late friends, each transfixed till the end by his artistic vocation &#x2014; the writer Bernard Malamud and the painter Philip Guston &#x2014; as well as several cartoons drawn by Guston, a gift to Roth to illustrate his novella THE BREAST and printed here for the first time. SHOP TALK concludes with Roth&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;Rereading Saul Bellow,&#x201d; a vivid presentation of Bellow&#x2019;s achievement and, in the spirit of this collection, very much a colleague&#x2019;s reading.</p><p>"A carefully researched and elegantly written book. It is all the more fascinating because the country in such deep denial of its wartime collaboration with the Nazis is not some benighted authoritarian state in Eastern Europe, but the fount of so many of our ideas about human rights, France. Half journalist, half historian, Nossiter winds past and present together with great skill." &#x2013;Adam Hochschild, author of <i>King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa</i> <p>"Adam Nossiter has given us a disturbing and riveting portrait of the afterlife of Nazi collaboration in France.

Silence has fueled preoccupation, Nossiter finds, when it comes to the French reckoning of their behavior during WW II. Those long-ago events continue to stir up deep passions, in what amounts to a kind of national auto-interrogation &#x2013; a process that is halting, distorted, and incomplete...A rattling congeries of the ghosts &#x2013; from collaboration to collusion to compromise &#x2013; that continue to bedevil France." &#x2013;Kirkus Reviews</p>In Philip Roth's intimate intellectual encounters with an international and diverse cast of writers, they explore the importance of region, politics and history in their work and trace the imaginative path by which a writer's highly individualized art is informed by the wider conditions of life. <br>With Primo Levi, Roth discusses the stubborn core of rationality that helped the Italian chemist-writer survive the demented laboratory of Auschwitz. With Milan Kundera, he analyzes the mix of politics and sexuality that made him the most subversive writer in communist Czechoslovakia. With Edna O'Brien, he explores the circumstances that have forced generations of Irish writers into exile. Elsewhere Roth offers appreciative portraits of two friends--the writer Bernard Malamud and the painter Philip Guston--at the end of their careers, and gives us a masterful assessment of the work of Saul Bellow. Intimate, charming, and crackling with ideas about the interplay between imagination and the writer's historical situation, Shop Talk is a literary symposium of the highest level, presided over by America's foremost novelist.</p><h2>The Guns of Avalon (Chronicles of Amber)</h2><p>The Guns of Avalon is the second book in the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.

Night after night, they swallowed their fears and flew long distances through packs of enemy fighters to drop the bombs that could destroy Hitler and bring about the end of the war. Tens of thousands of young men never came back, blown up or bailing out from burning aircraft to drop helplessley into enemy hands. Yet history has condemned their brave and valiant actions, denouncing them for the destruction of German cities and civilians, rather than acknowledging them for the heroes that they are. For the first time John Nichol and Tony Rennell tell the story of the controversial last battles of Bomber Command through the eyes of the heroic men who fought them. &#39;Gripping, moving and thoughtful.

Especially vulnerable were the "tail-end Charlies"---for the Americans, which meant two things: the gunners who flew countless missions in a plexiglass bubble at the back of the bomber, and the last bomber in the formation who ended up flying through the most hell, and for the British, the rear-gunners who flew operations in a Plexiglas bubble at the back of the bomber.<br>Following their groundbreaking revelations about the ordeals suffered by Allied prisoners of war in their bestselling book, <i>The Last Escape,</i> John Nichol and Tony Rennell tell the astonishing and deeply moving story of the controversial last battles in the skies of Germany through the eyes of the forgotten heroes who fought them.</p><p>"This is the best account that has been written of the heroic American and British bomber crews . . . the best of its kind." <br>---George McGovern</p><p>"Rivaling the best of Stephen Ambrose's work, <i>Tail-End Charlies</i> gives a breathtakingly intimate look at the lives, loves, and deaths of the brave airmen of the greatest generation.

The allegorical work revolves around the narrator's quest to live a good life, and takes the form of a series of dreams in which Piers, the honest plowman, appears in various guises. Characters such as Conscience, Fidelity and Charity, alongside Falsehood and Guile, are instantly recognizable as our present-day politicians and celebrities, friends and neighbors. Social issues are confronted, including governance, economic relations, criminal justice, marital relations and the limits of academic learning, as well as religious belief and the natural world. This new verse translation from the Middle English preserves the energy, imagery and intent of the original, and retains its alliterative style.</p><p><b>Peter Sutton</b> is a playwright, translator and editor.

Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: &#x201c;scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed...and, at the darkest level...the terror of isolation and nothingness.&#x201d;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i> (1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California fictions, <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932) and <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1939). Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <i>The Forgotten Village</i> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <i>Sea of Cortez</i> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing <i>Bombs Away</i> (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <i>The Moon Is Down</i> (1942). <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1947), <i>The Pearl</i> (1947), <i>A Russian Journal</i> (1948), another experimental drama, <i>Burning Bright</i> (1950), and <i>The Log from the</i> Sea of Cortez (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history. The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <i>Sweet Thursday</i> (1954), <i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i> (1957), <i>Once There Was a War</i> (1958), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), <i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> (1962), <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), and the posthumously published <i>Journal of a Novel: The</i> East of Eden <i>Letters</i> (1969), <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1975), <i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i> (1976), and <i>Working Days: The Journals of</i> The Grapes of Wrath (1989). He died in 1968, having won a Nobel Prize in 1962.</p><p>Throughout his life Steinbeck signed his letters with his personal &#x201c;Pigasus&#x201d; logo, symbolizing himself &#x201c;a lumbering soul but trying to fly.&#x201d; The Latin motto <i>Ad Astra Per Alia Porci</i> translates &#x201c;To the stars on the wings of a pig.&#x201d;</p><p>JOHN STEINBECK CENTENNIAL EDITION (1902-2002)</p><p><b>JOHN STEINBECK</b></p><p><b>Cannery Row</b></p><p>Table of Contents</p><p><b><i>Cannery Row</i></b></p><p>Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, &#x201c;whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,&#x201d; by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, &#x201c;Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,&#x201d; and he would have meant the same thing.</p><p>In the morning when the sardine fleet has made a catch, the purse-seiners waddle heavily into the bay blowing their whistles. The deep-laden boats pull in against the coast where the canneries dip their tails into the bay. The figure is advisedly chosen, for if the canneries dipped their mouths into the bay the canned sardines which emerge from the other end would be metaphorically, at least, even more horrifying. Then cannery whistles scream and all over the town men and women scramble into their clothes and come running down to the Row to go to work. Then shining cars bring the upper classes down: superintendents, accountants, owners who disappear into offices. Then from the town pour Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women in trousers and rubber coats and oilcloth aprons. They come running to clean and cut and pack and cook and can the fish. The whole street rumbles and groans and screams and rattles while the silver rivers offish pour in out of the boats and the boats rise higher and higher in the water until they are empty. The canneries rumble and rattle and squeak until the last fish is cleaned and cut and cooked and canned and then the whistles scream again and the dripping, smelly, tired Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women, straggle out and droop their ways up the hill into the town and Cannery Row becomes itself again&#x2014;quiet and magical. Its normal life returns. The bums who retired in disgust under the black cypress tree come out to sit on the rusty pipes in the vacant lot. The girls from Dora&#x2019;s emerge for a bit of sun if there is any. Doc strolls from the Western Biological Laboratory and crosses the street to Lee Chong&#x2019;s grocery for two quarts of beer. Henri the painter noses like an Airedale through the junk in the grass-grown lot for some part or piece of wood or metal he needs for the boat he is building. Then the darkness edges in and the street light comes on in front of Dora&#x2019;s&#x2014;the lamp which makes perpetual moonlight in Cannery Row. Callers arrive at Western Biological to see Doc, and he crosses the street to Lee Chong&#x2019;s for five quarts of beer.</p><p>How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise&#x2014;the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream&#x2014;be set down alive? When you collect marine animals there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be the way to write this book&#x2014;to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s grocery, while not a model of neatness, was a miracle of supply. It was small and crowded but within its single room a man could find everything he needed or wanted to live and to be happy&#x2014;clothes, food, both fresh and canned, liquor, tobacco, fishing equipment, machinery, boats, cordage, caps, pork chops. You could buy at Lee Chong&#x2019;s a pair of slippers, a silk kimono, a quarter pint of whiskey and a cigar. You could work out combinations to fit almost any mood. The one commodity Lee Chong did not keep could be had across the lot at Dora&#x2019;s.</p><p>The grocery opened at dawn and did not close until the last wandering vagrant dime had been spent or retired for the night. Not that Lee Chong was avaricious. He wasn&#x2019;t, but if one wanted to spend money, he was available. Lee&#x2019;s position in the community surprised him as much as he could be surprised. Over the course of the years everyone in Cannery Row owed him money. He never pressed his clients, but when the bill became too large, Lee cut off credit. Rather than walk into the town up the hill, the client usually paid or tried to.</p><p>Lee was round-faced and courteous. He spoke a stately English without ever using the letter R. When the tong wars were going on in California, it happened now and then that Lee found a price on his head. Then he would go secretly to San Francisco and enter a hospital until the trouble blew over. What he did with his money, no one ever knew. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t get it. Maybe his wealth was entirely in unpaid bills. But he lived well and he had the respect of all his neighbors. He trusted his clients until further trust became ridiculous. Sometimes he made business errors, but even these he turned to advantage in good will if in no other way. It was that way with the Palace Flophouse and Grill. Anyone but Lee Chong would have considered the transaction a total loss.</p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s station in the grocery was behind the cigar counter. The cash register was then on his left and the abacus on his right. Inside the glass case were the brown cigars, the cigarettes, the Bull Durham, the Duke&#x2019;s mixture, the Five Brothers, while behind him in racks on the wall were the pints, half pints and quarters of Old Green River, Old Town House, Old Colonel, and the favorite&#x2014;Old Tennessee, a blended whiskey guaranteed four months old, very cheap and known in the neighborhood as Old Tennis Shoes. Lee Chong did not stand between the whiskey and the customer without reason. Some very practical minds had on occasion tried to divert his attention to another part of the store. Cousins, nephews, sons and daughters-in-law waited on the rest of the store, but Lee never left the cigar counter. The top of the glass was his desk. His fat delicate hands rested on the glass, the fingers moving like small restless sausages. A broad golden wedding ring on the middle finger of his left hand was his only jewelry and with it he silently tapped on the rubber change mat from which the little rubber tits had long been worn. Lee&#x2019;s mouth was full and benevolent and the flash of gold when he smiled was rich and warm. He wore half-glasses and since he looked at everything through them, he had to tilt his head back to see in the distance. Interest and discounts, addition, subtraction he worked out on the abacus with his little restless sausage fingers, and his brown friendly eyes roved over the grocery and his teeth flashed at the customers.</p><p>On an evening when he stood in his place on a pad of newspaper to keep his feet warm, he contemplated with humor and sadness a business deal that had been consummated that afternoon and reconsummated later that same afternoon. When you leave the grocery, if you walk catty-cornered across the grass-grown lot, threading your way among the great rusty pipes thrown out of the canneries, you will see a path worn in the weeds. Follow it past the cypress tree, across the railroad track, up a chicken walk with cleats, and you will come to a long low building which for a long time was used as a storage place for fish meal. It was just a great big roofed room and it belonged to a worried gentleman named Horace Abbeville. Horace had two wives and six children and over a period of years he had managed through pleading and persuasion to build a grocery debt second to none in Monterey. That afternoon he had come into the grocery and his sensitive tired face had flinched at the shadow of sternness that crossed Lee&#x2019;s face. Lee&#x2019;s fat finger tapped the rubber mat. Horace laid his hands palm up on the cigar counter. &#x201c;I guess I owe you plenty dough,&#x201d; he said simply.</p><p>Lee&#x2019;s teeth flashed up in appreciation of an approach so different from any he had ever heard. He nodded gravely, but he waited for the trick to develop.</p><p>Horace wet his lips with his tongue, a good job from corner to corner. &#x201c;I hate to have my kids with that hanging over them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why, I bet you wouldn&#x2019;t let them have a pack of spearmint now.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s face agreed with this conclusion. &#x201c;Plenty dough,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Horace continued, &#x201c;You know that place of mine across the track up there where the fish meal is.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong nodded. It was his fish meal.</p><p>Horace said earnestly, &#x201c;If I was to give you that place&#x2014;would it clear me up with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong tilted his head back and stared at Horace through his half-glasses while his mind flicked among accounts and his right hand moved restlessly to the abacus. He considered the construction which was flimsy and the lot which might be valuable if a cannery ever wanted to expand. &#x201c;Shu,&#x201d; said Lee Chong.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, get out the accounts and I&#x2019;ll make you a bill of sale on that place.&#x201d; Horace seemed in a hurry.</p><p>&#x201c;No need papers,&#x201d; said Lee. &#x201c;I make paid-in-full paper.&#x201d;</p><p>They finished the deal with dignity and Lee Chong threw in a quarter pint of Old Tennis Shoes. And then Horace Abbeville walking very straight went across the lot and past the cypress tree and across the track and up the chicken walk and into the building that had been his, and he shot himself on a heap of fish meal. And although it has nothing to do with this story, no Abbeville child, no matter who its mother was, knew the lack of a stick of spearmint ever afterward.</p><p>But to get back to the evening. Horace was on the trestles with the embalming needles in him, and his two wives were sitting on the steps of his house with their arms about each other (they were good friends until after the funeral, and then they divided up the children and never spoke to each other again). Lee Chong stood in back of the cigar counter and his nice brown eyes were turned inward on a calm and eternal Chinese sorrow. He knew he could not have helped it, but he wished he might have known and perhaps tried to help. It was deeply a part of Lee&#x2019;s kindness and understanding that man&#x2019;s right to kill himself is inviolable, but sometimes a friend can make it unnecessary. Lee had already underwritten the funeral and sent a wash basket of groceries to the stricken families.</p><p>Now Lee Chong owned the Abbeville building&#x2014;a good roof, a good floor, two windows and a door. True it was piled high with fish meal and the smell of it was delicate and penetrating. Lee Chong considered it as a storehouse for groceries, as a kind of warehouse, but he gave that up on second thought. It was too far away and anyone can go in through a window. He was tapping the rubber mat with his gold ring and considering the problem when the door opened and Mack came in. Mack was the elder, leader, mentor, and to a small extent the exploiter of a little group of men who had in common no families, no money, and no ambitions beyond food, drink, and contentment. But whereas most men in their search for contentment destroy themselves and fall wearily short of their targets, Mack and his friends approached contentment casually, quietly, and absorbed it gently. Mack and Hazel, a young man of great strength, Eddie who filled in as a bartender at La Ida, Hughie and Jones who occasionally collected frogs and cats for Western Biological, were currently living in those large rusty pipes in the lot next to Lee Chong&#x2019;s. That is, they lived in the pipes when it was damp but in fine weather they lived in the shadow of the black cypress tree at the top of the lot. The limbs folded down and made a canopy under which a man could lie and look out at the flow and vitality of Cannery Row.</p><p>Lee Chong stiffened ever so slightly when Mack came in and his eyes glanced quickly about the store to make sure that Eddie or Hazel or Hughie or Jones had not come in too and drifted away among the groceries.</p><p>Mack laid out his cards with a winning honesty. &#x201c;Lee,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I and Eddie and the rest heard you own the Abbeville place.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong nodded and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I and my friends thought we&#x2019;d ast you if we could move in there. We&#x2019;ll keep up the property,&#x201d; he added quickly. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t let anybody break in or hurt anything. Kids might knock out the windows, you know&#x2014;&#x201d; Mack suggested. &#x201c;Place might burn down i...</p></p><h2>Hippocrates Vol. VI (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Hippocrates, said to have been born in Cos in or before 460 BCE, learned medicine and philosophy; travelled widely as a medical doctor and teacher; was consulted by King Perdiccas of Macedon and Artaxerxes of Persia; and died perhaps at Larissa. Apparently he rejected superstition in favour of inductive reasoning and the study of real medicine as subject to natural laws, in general and in individual people as patients for treatment by medicines and surgery. Of the roughly 70 works in the 'Hippocratic Collection' many are not by Hippocrates; even the famous oath may not be his. But he was undeniably the 'Father of Medicine'.</p><p>The works available in the Loeb Classical Library edition of Hippocrates are the following. Volume I: Ancient Medicine. Airs, Waters, Places. Epidemics 1 and 3. The Oath. Precepts. Nutriment. Volume II: Prognostic. Regimen in Acute Diseases. The Sacred Disease. The Art. Breaths. Law. Decorum. Physician (Ch. 1). Dentition. Volume III: On Wounds in the Head. In the Surgery. On Fractures. On Joints. Mochlicon. Volume IV: Nature of Man. Regimen in Health. Humours. Aphorisms. Regimen 1&#x2013;3. Dreams.

He received several awards recognizing his contribution to religious study and contemplation, including the Pax Medal in 1963, and remained a devoted spiritualist and a tireless advocate for social justice until his death in 1968. The Sign of Jonas was originally published in 1953.Jonathan Montaldo interprets Merton's work on enduring values, fulfillment, salvation, and the relationship between faith and human spirituality. Montaldo conveys complex ideas with simplicity and an impeccable delivery. The first essay on spiritual love is considered a classic. Montaldo gives a polished performance when he reflects on man's relationship with God, man's relationship with others, and why love can only be kept when it is given away. Other themes touch on hope, conscience, freedom, and prayer. Montaldo's delivery of Merton's material on Christian humanism and reciprocal love gives the listener food for thought. This well-done series of spiritual meditations provides a wellspring of enlightenment and encouragement. Fans of Thomas Merton will enjoy the flowing prose.

But the mission is too intriguing for her to refuse. She must fi nd an object that possesses a sacred and powerful secret offering atonement to anyone who uncovers it&#x2014;or wreaking havoc on the world.<br><br>Stolen from an ancient order of knights, the relic is now in the clutches of a band of pirates sailing the South China Sea. When a government leader threatens to destroy the pirate ship&#x2014;along with the artifact&#x2014;rather than let it get into the wrong hands, Annja must decide at what cost the sacred prize should be protected. Destroying it would defi le history. But saving it could bring about apocalypse.<br><br></p><p><br><br>A burst of automatic rifle fire in the grand ballroom shattered the band's bright dance music like a crow-bar smashing glass figurines from a shelf.<br><br>People screamed. Men in tails and white ties and women in elegant evening gowns threw themselves to the floor or clung to each other and trembled. Heads turned to stare at the half-dozen black-hooded men in loose green-and-black camouflage-pattern clothing who had burst in like wolves among pheasants.<br><br>And here I am practically naked in this ridiculous dress, Annja Creed thought, arched over backward with her hair almost brushing the elegant blue-and-gold carpet and only Garin Braden's strong right arm keeping her from falling.<br><br>SHE HAD THOUGHT the evening had started inauspiciously.<br><br>"How good of you to join me," Garin murmured when she presented herself at his table. Actually, she was presented by a bowing and scraping steward who acted as if he were giving a supermodel as a gift to a maharajah. Except a maharajah would probably not have received quite such deferential treatment.<br><br>Annja felt eyes sticking to her like clammy clumps of seaweed. She felt exposed in the clinging sheath of flame-colored silk he had picked out for her. Her long chestnut hair had been swirled atop her head by the cruise ship's expert staff of hairdressers. She suspected it made her look as if she had a soft-swirl ice-cream cone for a head. Around her slender neck she wore a delicate gold chain with an emerald pendant that Garin assured her would bring out the green highlights in her amber-green eyes. She knew it was exquisitely tasteful, just too small to be gaudy. But she could practically feel the weight of the money it had cost. It felt like an anchor.<br><br>"As if I had a choice," she said snidely as she allowed herself to be seated.<br><br>Garin laughed a rich baritone laugh. He was a charismatic devil, she had to give him that. And devilishly handsome. The catch was the consistent way devil kept creeping into her thoughts about him.<br><br>"There's always a choice, my dear," he said. "That is one thing life has taught me in no uncertain terms."<br><br>As always Annja felt conflicted about Garin, as she smiled and accepted the menu from the head-waiter. In his immaculate tuxedo with the star-sapphire stickpin, his black hair and goatee and dancing black-diamond eyes, Garin was admired by every woman in the room. He was charming, breathtakingly well-read and witty. He was vigorous, and as CEO and majority shareholder of the monster oil company EuroPetro he was, officially, richer than God. He was what most women in her position would consider one hell of a catch.<br><br>But hell was the operative word. That was the catch. <br><br>First of all, Annja had sworn off having affairs with men significantly older than she was. Not that he looked over the limit. Annja was in her mid-twenties. Garin appeared to be in his early thirties. But his real age belied that appearance&#x2014; by centuries.<br><br>And then, of course, there was the fact that, while he sometimes helped her&#x2014;indeed, she was paying off one of those debts at that moment&#x2014;he also had the unfortunate habit of trying, at entirely unpredictable intervals, to kill her.<br><br>Around them people chatted and drank wine from immaculate crystal and ate five-star food. The cruise ship Ocean Venture was the most modern and luxurious ocean liner yet built.<br><br>"I can't believe I let you blackmail me to serve as arm candy for some business negotiation," she said.<br><br>"Blackmail is an ugly word," Garin murmured over the top of his menu. "Besides, I believe extortion is more correct under the circumstances."<br><br>She glared at him through slitted eyes. <br><br>"You really must try the Pinot Noir. A splendid vintage. In any event, if you wish to keep your scruples inviolate, you can always choose to believe that you are here of your own free will. It's true, of course."<br><br>He held the crystal goblet up, where the light from the chandelier struck bloody highlights through the wine. "See? As I've told you, my dear. There's always a choice."<br><br>She winced.<br><br>He ordered for them. She didn't mind. It was the role he was playing. She was secure enough in her own independence not to feel threatened&#x2014;least of all by him.<br><br>She did have something he wanted. And she did keep it coyly and carefully hidden from public view. But it wasn't what most people would think.<br><br>It was a complicated dance they danced.<br><br>The food was excellent but Annja ate mechanically. Distracted by circumstances, she scarcely noticed what she consumed. Growing up in an orphanage in New Orleans' French Quarter, she had learned not to be picky about what she ate. As she spent more time on the Crescent City streets she had learned to appreciate good food. Subsequently, as a graduate student and then archaeologist on innumerable digs, and in the last few years trotting the globe as staff talking head and resident voice of reason on Chasing History's Monsters, she had learned to be quite adventurous about what she ate.<br><br>She was preoccupied, on the evening of the first full day at sea in the Caribbean.<br><br>"So why do you have me here?" she asked. <br><br>Garin smiled. "Reasons of my own." <br><br>The reason she was there was that he had called in a favor. A big one. A save-your-life favor&#x2014;not to mention the life of an innocent girl who'd depended on her.<br><br>Of course in the process of doing her that favor he had increased his wealth and influence almost exponentially. To his mind that failed to diminish the moral obligation one iota. What was worse was, he knew full well it didn't in her mind, either.<br><br>At some point in the future, when she wasn't still miffed about having her arm twisted, she would have to admit to herself there were worse fates than getting a free ocean cruise with a movie-star-handsome man who happened to be one of the world's richest. If she was a captive bird her cage was very well gilded by any standards.And her captivity, to call it that, would last no more than the four days of the cruise. But her fiercely independent nature bridled at it anyway.<br><br>"Come on," she said, spearing a piece of asparagus. "You owe me a better explanation than that."<br><br>He shrugged a broad, tuxedoed shoulder. "Perhaps you're right, Annja dear. I have no wish to torment you, after all. I am not a cruel man, you know&#x2014;I worked that out of my system long ago."<br><br>She tried not to shudder, and tried harder not to envision just what he meant.<br><br>"Although I'm maintaining a low profile on this voyage," he said, "and the world at large still does not know my face&#x2014;an expensive status to maintain, but well worth the investment&#x2014;I have a certain image to project to those with whom I'm carrying out a certain, most delicate negotiation."<br><br>His accent was vaguely and indeterminately European. She suspected it was an affectation. He no doubt could speak English better than she could. He'd had long enough to practice.<br><br>Nonetheless it did contribute to making him devastatingly sexy. Curse him anyway, she thought. This could turn out to be a very long voyage.<br><br>"Aren't you concerned about doing that under the noses of the Venezuelans?" she asked. The Ocean Venture had just steamed past Aruba in the Netherlands Antilles, and was scheduled to make landfall at Willemstad on the island of Cura�ao the next morning to allow sightseeing and, of course, a spree of shopping. Venezuela's north coast lay less than a hundred miles to the south.<br><br>"How do you know those aren't the ones I'm negotiating with? Their oil holdings might prove of interest to EuroPetro. They certainly do to the Chinese."<br><br>She looked at him hard. "Am I just arm candy?" she asked. She shook her head in almost reflex negation. "You could have your pick of supermodels or Hollywood stars. If you crooked one finger, Nicole Kidman would kick Keith Urban back into rehab and fly at you like somebody's wristwatch to the inside of an MRI machine."<br><br>He laughed with a gusto that made heads turn. He paid no mind. He did few things by halves. "You've a gift for unexpected expression," he said. "Indeed, you've a positive gift for the unexpected. Is it not enough to know that I savor that? Because I do. Not to mention your beauty, which to my sorrow you constantly denigrate, and which possesses, to these jaded old eyes, a freshness few celebrities&#x2014;especially the flavors of the week&#x2014;can match."<br><br>Annja snorted in a most unladylike way. "Flattery," she sputtered.<br><br>He scowled and she recoiled slightly. She feared a lot of things and a lot of people&#x2014;she had seen and experienced far too much not to&#x2014;but she was intimidated by no one. He came close, though.<br><br>"Please, my dear," he said, softening a degree or so, "never say such a thing again. I never flatter." Then that grin, youthful and ageless, returned. "It implies I need to."<br><br>"Point taken." Finding her plate empty, she set down her fork, propped her elbows to either side, laced her fingers in their flame-colored long gloves and rested her chin on them. "Now, give. Why is it so important to have me along?"<br><br>"Perhaps I feel the need of additional security," he said, with a roguish twinkle in his eye. Well, even more than usual. "You make a most exemplary bodyguard, as well as a&#x2014;shall we say&#x2014;disarm-ingly lovely one?"<br><br>She snorted again. "I don't want to set off that touchy Renaissance pride again," she said&#x2014;she was something of an authority on the Renaissance, it being her period of professional specialization as an archaeologist and historian. "But that seems rather hard to believe. You can afford to travel with a phalanx of top security men. And you do&#x2014;I've spotted a few of them on the boat. Immaculately dressed bald guys with wires in their ears."<br><br>"Ship," Garin corrected automatically. "Without meaning to denigrate your own falcon keenness of perception, don't you think potential evil-wishers can do at least as well spotting such men? Whereas you are an extraordinarily gifted amateur, some of them are lifelong professionals at the craft."<br><br>"Hel-lo," she said quietly, "you're immortal." He chuckled. "Being immortal doesn't necessarily mean I can't die," he said. "It just means I haven't."<br><br>He made an easy gesture with one hand. "I am extraordinarily tough to kill, I grant. But there are certain fates that might make me wish I could die. What if I was trapped at the bottom of the sea? So that I was perpetually drowning, but couldn't quite die? That would be like hell, would it not? So you see, I've plenty to fear. And of course, there is always my concern, now that you've claimed the sword, that my gift&#x2014;the one that old rake Roux perversely prefers to consider a curse&#x2014;of immortality might evaporate."<br><br>Annja's blood ran cold. She could never forget that Garin would&#x2014;if he could&#x2014;wrest the mystic sword of Joan of Arc away from her and break it to pieces again, as had the English soldiers who had captured St. Joan so many centuries before.<br><br>"Fear not, fair lady," Garin said, eyes dancing as he finished his wine. "So long as I continue to wake up each morning feeling hale and whole&#x2014;you can continue to wake up in the mornings. Shall we dance?"<br><br>"You're a bastard," she told him as he held her chair and helped her to her feet.<br><br>"Born that way," he acknowledged, "although I like to think I've earned the title on my own merits, over the years."<br><br>When the band, perched on its podium to one side of the great ballroom, struck up a tango,Annja thought for sure the evening couldn't possibly get any worse.<br><br>"I don't know how to tango," she snarled in Garin's ear.<br><br>"You'll be fine," he said. "You're a natural athlete. And a trained martial artist. Remember your taijiquan balance training."<br><br>"I don't do taijiquan in heels," she said. She knew now why they called them stilettos&#x2014;they were like daggers stabbing her feet at every step. As much experience as she had wearing heels&#x2014;very little&#x2014;she walked in them with all the grace of a drunken baby duck. Whereas she danced in the high spike heels, she thought, like a water buffalo on skates. But a tango&#x2014; "I'll break an ankle!"<br><br>He laughed softly. "Follow my lead," he said. "It's worked splendidly for you so far."<br><br>She struggled to keep her irritation from showing on her face. Her gown was backless, and its bodice consisted of what she tried not to think of as bunny ears from just south of her navel upward, diminishing to bitty strings tied behind her neck. It was held in place either by some kind of surface tension, like a bubble, or through magic. And she didn't believe in magic.<br><br>She'd seen the tango sequences in True Lies. She secretly identified with Jamie Lee Curtis, a sort of standard-bearer for gawky women who could still be darned sexy. But once Garin started flinging her around she feared it would be mere seconds before her boobs came flying out of the dress like startled pigeons.<br><br>"Trust me," Garin said with a wicked grin.<br><br>"Yeah," she whispered furiously. "It's not like you've tried to kill me."<br><br>"Not recently," he said. "And most assuredly not here."<br><br>The preliminary violin strains died away. She felt his hand burning at the small of her bare back as if heated in a forge.<br><br>The tango began in earnest. He leaned forward. In response she leaned back, bent over his strong grasp. She felt her breasts ride up her rib cage and thought, This is not good.<br><br>That was when the terrorists barged in and fired a burst into the ceiling.<br><br>PROVENANCE is the latest in the series of a young archaeologist with a magic sword. As with all Graphic Audio&#39;s &#34;movie-in-your-mind&#34; presentations, the production is a full-cast performance with more special effects than can be found in a dozen other audio programs. The different actors help the listener keep the characters straight in this story of the hunt for a mysterious coffin containing a priceless relic. The special effects can be a bit overpowering at times, as when the performer must compete with an airplane engine and loud music. While most of the production maintains a careful balance between the special effects and the voices of Nanette Savard and more than a dozen others, there are a few places where less would have been more.

Higgins' odyssey of&nbsp;&nbsp;discovery has spanned three decades and led him&nbsp;&nbsp;across boundaries of geography, nationality, and&nbsp;&nbsp;culture. In these pages Higgins combines 220 tri-tone&nbsp;&nbsp;black-and-white images with his own evocative&nbsp;&nbsp;prose to share the findings of his journey. From&nbsp;&nbsp;reclaiming a long-misrepresented history, to providing&nbsp;&nbsp;a rare, intimate look at sacred rituals passed&nbsp;&nbsp;down through the centuries, to exploring the simple&nbsp;&nbsp;yet profound significance of water in daily life,&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester Higgins Jr. presents a glorious evocation&nbsp;&nbsp;of the African personality as it thrives not just in Africa, but in all parts of the world.</p><p></p><h2>Atlantis: Ancient Legacy, Hidden Prophecy</h2><p><p>"Plato's account contains precise references to the catastrophic global flooding that followed the end of the last ice age and peaked at the exact date he gives for the drowning of Atlantis.

Herman Nickerson Jr., USMC*<br></b><b><i>Marine Corps Gazette</i></b><b>, February 1959</b><br><br><i>Force Recon--By Land, Sea, and Air</i>, written by, then, Brig. Gen. Herman<br>Nickerson, Jr., February 1959, and published in the <i>Marine Corps Gazette</i>,<br>defines the new company's mission, main tasks, and capabilities. Using an<br>amphibious operation ("Strongback") conducted in the Philippines in 1958,<br>General Nickerson explains, in depth, the concept of how the Force Recon<br>Company performs the task of gaining "timely" information to assist the<br>commander in arriving at decisions and in executing it's other vital roles<br>in the landings.<br><br>"The job: Reduce the Uncertainty." So wrote Brig. Gen. J. M. Masters Sr.<br>in the June 1958 <i>Gazette</i>. "Uncertainty is an ugly three-headed spook,<br>which will haunt the commander. . . . The spook's three heads? The enemy,<br>the weather, and the terrain. . . ."<br><br>To this statement of the intelligence officer's job we could add a job<br>description: use available tools skillfully to strip<br><br>*Credited as "The God-Father of Long-Range Reconnaissance," Lt. Gen.<br>General Nickerson assumed command of III MAF in March 1969. Immediately<br>realizing the need for reconnaissance information beyond that provided<br>division commanders by their respective recon battalions, he put theory to<br>form when he tasked 1st Force Recon Company to conduct deep patrol<br>operations for the MAF in June, followed by the reconstituted 3d Force<br>Reconnaissance Company in October of that year.--Ed.<br><br>the veils from the three-headed spook and provide the commander with the<br>information he needs to make a sound decision. One of the commander's best<br>tools, in my opinion, is the force recon company. By well-conceived<br>employment of this organization, many of the uncertainties can be reduced.<br>Only when the commander has the best available information on the enemy,<br>weather, and terrain can he confidently order "Launch helicopters!" and<br>"Land the landing force!"<br><br>Perhaps the greatest difference of opinion on modern amphibious tactics<br>and techniques arises from: first, the debate as to whether or not nuclear<br>munitions will be used; and second, the size and degree of unit<br>separation. No matter what size the separation unit is that lands by<br>helicopter in the amphibious assault, we can all agree that the highest<br>order of intelligence is required for this unit to "stay loose," hit hard,<br>then saddle up and move out rapidly--avoiding, all the while, the<br>unproductive moment of nuclear-weapon target-size concentration. How,<br>then, shall we succeed in unveiling the spook?<br><br>Within force troops, in both FMFLant and FMFPac, we have the key to unlock<br>a part of the Houdini apparatus--the force reconnaissance company. The<br>proper utilization of these highly skilled "eyeballs" and "eardrums" is<br>the skeleton key to success in modern amphibious warfare.<br><br>The general missions of these companies are to support <br>a landing force by: first, conducting a pre-assault and post-assault<br>amphibious and parachute reconnaissance; and second, conducting<br>pre-assault and post-assault parachute and other pathfinding missions.<br><br>A force reconnaissance company is a part of the task organization of the<br>landing force and is employed to extend the ground reconnaissance<br>capability of that force beyond the coverage afforded by the organic<br>reconnaissance battalion of Marine divisions. As noted in the mission,<br>this is accomplished by pre-assault terrestrial reconnaissance using<br>amphibious and parachute means. To conduct post-assault deep<br>reconnaissance, helicopter lift and parachuting are used. The company<br>employs helicopters to establish and displace deep observation posts for<br>battlefield surveillance. The reconnaissance-surveillance portion of the<br>force reconnaissance company's mission must be closely monitored by the<br>landing force G-2 to insure that all efforts are integrated into the<br>overall intelligence collection plan. Only by obtaining and using all<br>available information can the intelligence officer fit together the<br>assorted pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and present the commander with a<br>clear picture.<br><br>In addition, the force reconnaissance company is employed to provide<br>parachute pathfinder services in the approach and retirement lanes and<br>helicopter landing zones, in amphibious and subsequent land operations.<br>Pathfinder teams provide pre-assault navigational assistance to<br>helicopters in approach to and along approach-retirement lanes.<br><br>Pathfinder teams provide terminal guidance to the helicopter assault waves<br>in the landing zones, in either day or night operations. Final pre-H-hour<br>reports of enemy activity, obstacles, weather, and radiological<br>contamination in the landing zones and near vicinity are made by these<br>pathfinder teams. Pathfinders are capable of limited obstacle clearance,<br>should this work be necessary, and they provide emergency communication<br>support and assembly aid to the helicopter-landed troops.<br><br>The main tasks of a force reconnaissance company, then, are: First, to<br>perform pre-D-day reconnaissance as required by the overall intelligence<br>collection plan, using parachute and amphibious means; second, to provide<br>pathfinder services. In order to do these jobs, the company is<br>functionally organized to plan and execute--with the support of tactical<br>and transport fixed-winged aircraft, helicopters, and naval vessels--the<br>following tactical missions: perform pre-D-day amphibious reconnaissance<br>of any landing beaches required by the landing plan; establish<br>coastwatcher stations or inland observation posts after D-day, if<br>required; execute pre-D-day parachute reconnaissance of helicopter landing<br>zones--of the approach and retirement lanes thereto--and of other key inland<br>installations of interest to the Marine expeditionary force; conduct<br>post-D-day reconnaissance, by helicopter or parachute, of critical areas<br>beyond the range of division reconnaissance means; and finally, render<br>necessary parachute or pathfinder support to assault waves.<br><br>These varied tasks are accomplished by fourteen officers and 147 enlisted,<br>organized into a company headquarters of four officers and thirty-three<br>enlisted; a parachute reconnaissance platoon of three officers and<br>twenty-three enlisted; and an amphibious reconnaissance platoon of two<br>officers and twenty-three enlisted. A major (0302) is in command. Twelve<br>officers and ninety-seven enlisted Marines are on parachute jump status.</p><h2>The Partitions of Memory: The Afterlife of the Division of India</h2><p><p>Echoes of the traumatic events surrounding the Partition of India in 1947 can be heard to this day in the daily life of the subcontinent, each time India and Pakistan play a cricket match or when their political leaders speak of "unfinished business." Sikhs who lived through the pogrom following the assassination of Indira Gandhi recall Partition, as do, most recently, Muslim communities targeted by mobs in Gujarat. </p><p>The eight essays in The Partitions of Memory suggest ways in which the tangled skein of Partition might be unraveled. The contributors range over issues as diverse as literary reactions to Partition; the relief and rehabilitation measures provided to refugees; children&#x2019;s understanding of Partition; the power of "national" monuments to evoke a historical past; the power of letters to evoke more immediately poignant pasts; and the Dalit claim, at the prospect of Partition, to a separate political identity. The book demonstrates how fundamental the material and symbolic histories of Partition are to much that has happened in South Asia since 1947.</p><p>Contributors: <br>Mukulika Banerjee, Urvashi Butalia, Joya Chatterji, Priyamvada Gopal, Suvir Kaul, Nita Kumar, Sunil Kumar, Richard Murphy, and Ramnarayan S.

For the scattered survivors, wandering through a country turned into a gigantic graveyard, life has become a nightmare struggle. They escaped death, but now something even more terrifying is waiting to claim them -The most fiendish force ever to seek all humanity as slaves and victims. A strange, faceless, clairvoyant figure that is reaching for thier very souls...&#39;Classic Early Stephen King&#39;</p><p>In 1978, science fiction writer Spider Robinson wrote a scathing review of <i>The Stand</i> in which he exhorted his readers to grab strangers in bookstores and beg them not to buy it.<p> <i>The Stand</i> is like that. You either love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. Stephen King's most popular book, according to polls of his fans, is an end-of-the-world scenario: a rapidly mutating flu virus is accidentally released from a U.S. military facility and wipes out 99 and 44/100 percent of the world's population, thus setting the stage for an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil.</p><p> "I <i>love</i> to burn things up," King says. "It's the werewolf in me, I guess.... <i>The Stand</i> was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on <i>The Stand</i> came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke."</p><p> There is much to admire in <i>The Stand</i>: the vivid thumbnail sketches with which King populates a whole landscape with dozens of believable characters; the deep sense of nostalgia for things left behind; the way it subverts our sense of reality by showing us a world we find familiar, then flipping it over to reveal the darkness underneath. Anyone who wants to know, or claims to know, the heart of the American experience needs to read this book. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.<br><br>And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abigail -- and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.<br><br>In 1978 Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.<br><br>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand</i> : <i>The Complete And Uncut Edition</i> includes more than five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral comlexity of a true epic.<br><br>For hundreds of thousands of fans who read <i>The Stand</i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are reading <i>The Stand</i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.</p><h2>Duet in Beirut</h2><p><p>Expelled Mossad agent, Ronen, has disappeared following a failed assassination attempt on the life of the Hezbollah operative responsible for suicide bombings in Israel.

Original.</p><p>Many books will tell you how you should organize your life. This one doesn&#39;t tell you that you should follow &#34;systems&#34; and hard rules. It gently leads you to understand why you clutter, how it affects every aspect of your life, why an approach of &#34;practical spirituality&#34; can help you more than a to-do list, and then gives you some very practical tips that only a real clutterer would know. Mr. Nelson approaches a very serious problem that affects millions with a sensitivity that only a fellow sufferer could have, and a wry humor that makes the journey to recovery less painful. One of the stories is about a rock and roll star who has 27 refrigerators! If you&#39;ve tried and tried to organize, and read other books that didn&#39;t seem to speak your language, this book is for you. It passes into the realm of books that can change your life. Unique in Mr. Nelson&#39;s approach is that he addresses the strains that cluttering can have on relationships. He&#39;s personally released over a ton of useless items. Financial clutter is also addressed. Medical experts, religious leaders, professional organizers, businessmen and clutterers themselves all present their views of the elephant. Mr. Nelson ties them together to show the whole animal.I was lead to write this book as I learned just how destructive cluttering was to my life. It destroyed relationships, cost me money, lost me a dream job and blocked my spirituality. You are not alone. There are millions of us, and this book is one way for us to reclaim our lives. I use the teachings of many spiritual leaders to guide us on the way: Laotze, Buddha, Jesus and, of course, General George S. Patton Jr.</p><h2>Expo 58: A Novel</h2><p><p>A comic spy caper and international love story, set in Europe in the middle of the last century, <i>Expo 58</i> is the latest sublime creation by Jonathan Coe, hailed by Nick Hornby as &#x201c;probably the best English novelist of his generation.&#x201d;</p><p>Handsome, unassuming Thomas Foley is an employee at the Central Office of Information whose particular biography (Belgian mother, pub-owning father) makes him just the man to oversee the &#x201c;authentic British pub&#x201d; that will be erected at the 1958 Brussels World&#x2019;s Fair.

Her sister is still crazy, and her mom still has pink plastic flamingos in her front yard. And Jackson Lamott Parrish, the bad boy she'd left behind, is still so sexy it hurts. She'd like nothing better than to avoid this particular man, but she can't. Daisy has something to say to Jackson, and she's not going anywhere until he listens.</p><p>Jackson learned his lesson about Daisy the hard way, and now the only word he's interested in hearing from Daisy's red lips is good-bye. But she's popping up everywhere, and he doesn't believe in coincidence. It seems the only way to keep her quiet is with his mouth, but kissing Daisy had once been his downfall. Is he strong enough to resist her now? Strong enough to watch her walk out of his life again? Is he strong enough to make her stay?</p></p><p><p>Rachel Gibson began her fiction career at age sixteen, when she ran her car into the side of a hill, retrieved the bumper, and drove to a parking lot, where she strategically scattered the car&#x2019;s broken glass all about. She told her parents she&#x2019;d been the victim of a hit-and-run and they believed her. She&#x2019;s been making up stories ever since, although she gets paid better for them nowadays.</p>To call Gibson's newest contemporary romance "humorous" and "affecting" wouldn't be doing it justice. Gibson is in top form here, and the sheer magnetism of her characters and the warmth of her small-town setting will ensure that her fans devour this tale as readily as they did her last (See Jane Score). Thirty-three-year-old Daisy Lee Brooks possesses a rare maturity for a romance heroine. She has been a wife and mother for 15 years and now, as a widow, she has returned to her hometown of Lovett, Texas to set things right with the one person she has terribly wronged, Jackson Parrish, her former lover and the unwitting father of her 15-year-old son. Jackson, however, has never forgiven her for abandoning him the week his parents died and marrying their mutual best friend, Steven, and he's determined to avoid her&#x2014;a task made difficult by Daisy's persistence and his still intense attraction to her. Although the sexual chemistry between the two is near palpable and their banter never lacks for wit, what's really impressive is how much the protagonists grow throughout the book and have grown since their initial affair, which is revealed through flashbacks. Secondary characters like Daisy's smart-alecky son and her bitter, newly divorced sister also shine, making this a well-rounded and truly noteworthy read. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The story of respectable Dr Jekyll&#39;s strange association with &#39;damnable young man&#39; Edward Hyde; the hunt through fog-bound London for a killer; and the final revelation of Hyde&#39;s true identity is a chilling exploration of humanity&#39;s basest capacity for evil. This edition also includes Stevenson&#39;s chilling story &#39;The Bottle Imp&#39;. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Thought and character are one, he says, and as character can only manifest and discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer conditions of a person s life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state."<br><br>And thus James Allen teaches two essential truths: today we are where our thoughts have taken us, and we are the architects - for better or worse - of our futures. Perhaps one of the greatest writers of this century, he portrays the Truth clearly, eloquently and with no misunderstanding. AS A MAN THINKETH is a timeless piece.</p><p>JAMES ALLEN (1864-1912) was an Englishman who retired from the business world to pursue a lifestyle of writing and contemplation. His books are classics in the fields of inspiration and spirituality. Although best known for As a Man Thinketh, he authored several other books that deal with the power of thought including The Path to Prosperity, The Mastery of Destiny, The Way of Peace, and Entering the Kingdom.Literally a blueprint on living, this little gem serves as a course of action for approaching life in a meaningful manner. AS A MAN THINKETH contains practical philosophy for successful living, and has awakened millions to the discovery and perception of the truth <p> Weaving his way through the inner dynamics the human psyche, James Allen shows us what we already intuitively know: how changing ones' mind-set can improve one's circumstances - no matter how difficult. Written in a succinct, easy-to-digest style, AS A MAN THINKETH is a valuable tool for anyone serious about achieving a purpose-filled life.</p></p><h2>The Pacific Crest Trail: A Hiker&#39;s Companion</h2><p><p><strong>A narrative field guide to the unique plants, animals, history, and landscapes of the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail.</strong></p> For many people, the Pacific Crest is the ultimate long-distance hiking trail. Beginning in the dry valleys of southern California, it follows the crest of the snow-capped Sierras, and ends in the ancient forests of Washington's Cascades. Along the way, national treasures such as Yosemite, Crater Lake, and Mount Rainier make this trail one of the premier hiking destinations in the world. But hiking is about much more than getting from A to B. This book begins where basic trail guides and maps leave off. For each section of the trail, the authors describe the route in detail and recommend the best day hikes and short backpacks from each trailhead. They describe the plants and animals hikers will see, tell stories about local history, explain plate tectonics, and in a thousand other ways enrich the experiences of the journey. In addition, Berger and Smith draw on their tremendous experience&#x2015;together, they have logged more than 12,000 miles on the PCT&amp;mdash:to give tested advice to long-distance hikers on trip planning, gear and safety, seasonal considerations, trailheads and resupplies, permits, and much more.

In 1929, George Macy founded the Limited Editions Club and began publishing illustrated books in limited numbers (usually 1500 copies) for subscription members. In 1935 Macy founded the Heritage Club, which together with the Heritage Press, created and distributed more affordable reprints of the great books. Most of the books were beautifully illustrated with original artwork by leading book illustrators. This volume was illustrated by Arthur Szyk (1894-1951), a Polish-Jewish artist who worked primarily as a book illustrator and political artist throughout his decades-long career. Arthur Szyk was born into a prosperous middle-class Jewish family in the part of Poland which was under Russian rule in the 19th century. Arthur Szyk became a renowned artist and book illustrator as early as the interwar period. His works were exhibited and published not only in Poland, but also in France, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. However, he gained broad popularity in the U.S. primarily through his political caricatures in which, after the outbreak of WWII, he savaged the policies and personalities of the leaders of the Axis powers. After the war, he also devoted himself to political issues, especially the support of the creation of the state of Israel. In 1940, the American publisher George Macy, who saw his illustrations for the Haggadah at an exhibition in London, asked him to illustrate the Rubaiyat, the Book of Job, a collection of fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen, and Charles Perrault. The author of the Introduction, Mary Ellen Chase (1887-1973), was an American educator, teacher, scholar, and author. She is regarded as one of the most important regional literary figures of the early twentieth century. She taught at Smith College starting in 1926 until her retirement in 1955. Chase wrote more than 30 books, many using her cherished Maine heritage as the setting</p><p></p><h2>Greatest Books You&#39;ll Never Read: Unpublished masterpieces by the world&#39;s greatest writers</h2><p>Why was Thomas Hardy's first novel never published?

And so she slept, seemingly destined to be forgotten &#x2013; or, to put it more exactly, never to be remembered.&nbsp;<br><br>How things have changed! Numerous novels by Dawn Powell are currently available, along with her diaries and short stories. She has joined the Library of America, admitted to the illustrious company of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Adams, Frederick Douglass, and Edith Wharton. She is taught in college and read with delight on vacation. For the contemporary poet and novelist Lisa Zeidner, writing in<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Powell &#x201c;is wittier than Dorothy Parker, dissects the rich better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, is more plaintive than Willa Cather in her evocation of the heartland, and has a more supple control of satirical voice than Evelyn Waugh.&#x201d; For his part, Gore Vidal offered a simple reason for Powell&#x2019;s sudden popularity in the early Twentieth Century: &#x201c;We are catching up to her.&#x201d;<br><br>Dawn Powell was born in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, on November 28, 1896, the second of three daughters. Her father was a traveling salesman, and her mother died a few days after Dawn turned seven.

Dawn worked her way through college and made it to New York. There she married a young advertising executive and had one child, a boy who suffered from autism, then an unknown condition.<br><br>Powell referred to herself as a &#x201c;permanent visitor&#x201d; in her adopted Manhattan and brought to her writing a perspective gained from her upbringing in Middle America.

Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel have, once again, compiled an exciting array of never-before-published stories both from talented newcomers and award-winning genre veterans. In Kraig Blackwelder&#39;s Coyote Love, a man wakes up in a stranger&#39;s bed, not knowing how he got there. Terror ensues as the reader is shown just how far a person is willing to go to deny reality. In The WereSlut of Avenue A, Leslie What shows us that change is not always a good thing as we witness what may or may not be a physical transformation into something inhuman. These stories, written by writers both gay and straight, incite fear and spur thought. Contributors include Brian A. Hopkins, Holly Wade Matter, A.J. Potter, Carrie Richerson, Mark Tiedmann, Alexis Glynn Latner and more.</p><p>Nicola Griffith is a world-renowned speculative fiction author. Her novels <i>Ammonite</i> and <i>Slow River</i> won the Lambda Award and Slow River won the Nebula Award.<br><br> Stephen Pagel is publisher of Meisha Merlin Publishing.The editors' third anthology of original gay and lesbian fiction (following 1998's Bending the Landscape: Science Fiction) is more of a mixed bag than its predecessors, "horror" being a convenient label for mainly ironic stories preoccupied with romance and extreme behavior. The tale perhaps most closely fitting the traditional horror mold is Simon Sheppard's Poe-esque "What Are You Afraid Of?," an intense inner narrative filled with film allusions and some sardonic reflections on S&amp;M. In Barbara Hambly's "'Til Death," an amusing variant on Sartre's No Exit, an airport becomes a metaphor for hell as two women continually miss their flights while one shops and the other hunts a blonde. Fantasy is really the book's strong suit, as shown in L. Timmel Duchamp's "Explanations Are Clear," in which a visit to a tolerant Cajun family by two female lovers leads to tragedy in a Louisiana swamp. Two stories amount to SF: Holly Wade Matter's "Memorabilia," a sad soliloquy on the impossibility of relationships in a ruined world, and Mark W. Tiedemann's "Passing," an unsettling police procedural set in a violently antigay world where secretly gay police must persecute homosexuals. The overall high quality of these stories, whatever their label, should please the obvious target audience, as well as those horror buffs who aren't put off by explicit gay sex. (Apr. 26)it's actually the third; White Wolf published the initial volume, Bending the Landscape: Fantasy (1997).<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Crewel embroidery</h2><p>An illustrated guide to the stitches, design, and finishing of creative crewel embroidery</p><p></p><h2>When You Look Like Your Passport Photo, It&#39;s Time to Go Home</h2><p><p>The popular humorist offers tips and truisms on travel, discussing oddly named food, Asian bus drivers in Germany, plumbing around the world, and more.</p></p><p>Erma Bombeck, one of the most popular newspaper columnists in the United States and the author of numerous bestselling books, died in San Francisco on Monday, April 22, 1996 from complications following a kidney transplant earlier in the month.<p>Bombeck had been ill for some time. In 1992, after she underwent a mastectomy, her kidneys failed and she began dialysis at her home in Arizona. She suffered from polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary complaint.

Huddled in a lumpy bed in Papua New Guinea, listening to a tribal war play itself out in the street outside her hotel room, Bombeck reflects on the privileges earned by a life of hard work, prudent financial management, and a taste for adventure. Over the years, not only have she and her husband (as well as, at the worst of times, her three reluctant adolescent kids) been blessed with the chance to drag 50-pound suitcases from airport terminal to taxi queue to hotel lobby to hotel room and back again (or else, when the luggage is lost in transit, to spend two weeks in Tahiti in three-piece suits), but they have splurged on bus tours that allotted 15 minutes to view the Book of Kells in Ireland and an hour and a half to tour a sweater factory; on a private car whose driver spoke English like an Italian Henry Kissinger with a lip full of Novocain; on a villa in which the staff spoke only Spanish and the guests were reduced to rubbing their tummies at the cook and saying, ``Yummy, yummy!''; and on a glamorous cruise through the fjords of Norway, where Bombeck and spouse ate 17 meals a day and outgrew their clothes, only to find half the crew camped out in the exercise room. Worldly wisdom gained by years of experience with Turkish bathrooms, Montezuma's revenge, and transporting native spears home on American airlines has impressed on Bombeck the basic commonality of all cultures and has inspired her to suggest that instead of stockpiling nuclear weapons we should aim our vacation slides at one another. Classic Bombeck, in which she does away with any notion of an empty-nest syndrome. (Literary Guild Dual Selection for August.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Their biggest problem by far is their childless marriage (Ellen's miscarriage was reported at the end of the earlier novel). Her secret reason for being in this cabin on her grandparents' land in the dead of winter is to write a journal about that lost child, and so assuage her guilt. Chris, too, is here to write; his dissertation on the poet Roethke's journey toward the animism of Indian culture will, he hopes, make his own purposes clearer. For Chris is part Indian; though he ``wanted to pass,'' and has succeeded, he now feels his Indian heritage asserting itself. Meanwhile, there are less psychic matters demanding attention. A broken pump needs fixing; a prowler is lurking in the woods; and some Indian kids, young punks, keep pestering Chris to buy beer for them. Add to that list prejudiced bartenders in town; a teenage arsonist roaming the countryside; an aggrieved Indian who mistakenly thinks Chris shot at his wife at the town dump...well, it all makes for a busy life. What it doesn't make for is an engaging novel, for mostly Woiwode is just crying wolf (that prowler, for example, is not unmasked until the final pages), and all these nuisances throw the novel out of whack, distracting us from the serious business of Chris and Ellen trying to break free from their pasts (a cruel father in Chris's case, a sinister grandmother in Ellen's). The result? An unworkable combination of the identity-crisis novel and the city-slickers-surrounded-by- hostile-rubes genre, delivered in prose that is all thistles and thorns. A sad fumble by this major American writer. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>More than two decades have passed since Woiwode exploded onto the literary scene with the novel What I'm Going to Do, I Think. Now, having written the distinguished novels Born Brothers and Beyond the Bedroom Wall , Woiwode has returned to his first novel's characters and setting in a sequel that matches the intensity of his early work while showing the finesse of his more recent books. It is seven years after the events of What I'm Going to Do , and Chris and Ellen are in her grandparents' cabin in northern Michigan. Chris is struggling to finish his dissertation on American poetry. But before he can come to terms with Roethke, Chris must reckon with his own identity. He seems conscious of his Native American heritage for the first time, but even as it starts to accrete significance for him, he blunders through a series of awkward encounters with local Native Americans, antagonizing a malevolent few. As in Woiwode's first novel, Chris (still armed with his .22) is the center of the fictional universe, while Ellen floats at the edges. A toughness, a brusqueness pervades the oblique forms of communication in Michigan's northern woods, and Woiwode has an uncanny ability to go from mystical transcendence to slapstick in the course of a page. Readers familiar with his work will be delighted with this novel, but it isn't a particularly good place to start reading Woiwode, as its pace and setting can become relentlessly claustrophobic for those not sufficiently initiated. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Theology for the Social Gospel</h2><p>Walter Rauschenbusch has created a greatly needed theological approach to the question of Social Gospel.

He has won the American Book Award and earned accolades from the American Library Association and the American Institute of Graphic Arts. Mr. Moser lives in western Massachusetts.Grade 2 Up?This narrative poem asks God to look over all those who participate in Little League baseball as another season approaches. Morris leaves nary a soul unmentioned, including the "retributive daddies" and "faithful mothers." Blessings are petitioned for those who cheer and those who arbitrate, i.e., umpires. Young ballpayers will be interested in finding out what the author asks the Almighty to bestow upon those who play their own particular positions such as the request that infielders be granted "deft shovel dips and 6-4-3 double plays." Moser's trademark watercolors spill over full pages, deftly portraying all involved including ethnically diverse young ballplayers of both sexes. While the picture-book format will make this title visually attractive to a young audience, the text includes such words as ordinance, inexorable, and assuage, which will require adult interpretation. Morris's skillful prose melds neatly with Moser's fine paintings, creating an end product that will delight all who participate in, or follow the game of baseball. Direct fans of this title to Lillian Morrison's At the Crack of the Bat (Hyperion, 1992) and Lee Bennett Hopkins's Extra Innings (Harcourt, 1993), two collections of baseball poems.?Tom S.

At the age of fifteen, the young monarch set about uniting all the Franks barbarian tribes that inhabited much of the region that became modern-day France and Germany. A fierce warrior and an astute administrator, he expanded his originally modest kingdom in northeast Gaul (France) by all possible means, including conquest, marriage, diplomacy, and deception. When he married Clotilda, a devout Roman Catholic, he converted to Catholicism and became instrumental in spreading his new religion across Europe. By the time Clovis died in 511, his domain covered most of Western Europe, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the source of the Danube River. The French regard him as the founder of their monarchy.</p><p>Earle Rice Jr. is a former senior design engineer and technical writer in the aerospace, electronic-defense, and nuclear industries.

Earle is listed in Who s Who in America and is a member of the Society of Children s Book Writers and Illustrators, the League of World War I Aviation Historians, the Air Force Association, and the Disabled American Veterans.Aimed at the &#x201c;not-so-enthusiastic reader,&#x201d; titles in the Biography from Ancient Civilizations: Legends, Folklore, and Stories of Ancient Worlds series introduce their subjects with lively narratives filled with anecdotes and quotes about the profiled historical figures that will spark students&#x2019; curiosity. In The Life and Times of Clovis, King of the Franks, Rice provides no references for a moment in which Clovis &#x201c;showed no outward sign of emotion but a wound began to fester in his heart.&#x201d; Still, the well-integrated specifics create engaging portraits of world-changing leaders and their times. A few blurry artists&#x2019; renderings crop up in each title, but for the most part, the numerous visuals, including maps, reproductions from illuminated manuscripts, and photos of artifacts, such as weaponry, will draw students into the compelling stories. A personal chronology, a time line setting each life in context, chapter notes for direct quotes, a glossary, and suggestions for further reading complete these titles that seek to generate high interest in ancient history.

This catalogue accompanies an exhibition of over 250 Olmec works of art - ceramic, jade and stone - on display at the Art Museum, Princeton University in December 1995, and travelling to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Essays by prominent scholars offer interpretations of such topics as the power of objects within the context of the Olmec ritual system. These identify and illustrate the fundamental themes of Olmec small-scale sculpture, the sacred role of the maize in Olmec ideology, and the relationship of Olmec culture to later civilizations. An illustrated glossary of motifs and symbols is provided to clarify the often highly abstract style and encoded iconography of the Olmec. The book also includes precise mineralogical descriptions of the lithic materials they used.</p><p></p><h2>Through a Glass Darkly Patrick Hamilton</h2><p>Compiled with the help of access to his private papers, this is a biography of Patrick Hamilton, who was one of the most gifted and admired writers of his generation. Born in Sussex in 1904, the son of a clergyman, he published his first novel, &#34;Craven House&#34;, in 1925, and within a few years had established a wide readership. Two plays - &#34;Rope&#34; (on which Hitchcock based his film) and &#34;Gaslight&#34; - brought him great commercial success, and his high point as a novelist was reached with &#34;The Slaves of Solitude&#34; and &#34;Hangover Square&#34;. Hamilton was plagued by contradictions. Despite his genteel background, he became an expert chronicler of the English boarding-house, the twilight world of backstreet pubs and the quiet desperation of everyday life. An ideological Marxist, he reverted in later years to blimpish Toryism. Excessively and morbidly sensitive, he sought - with sometimes menacing zeal - his &#34;ideal woman&#34;, and would then indulge with equal intensity in his taste for bondage with prostitutes. And, in keeping with one of his work&#39;s recurring themes, he drank himself to death.</p><p></p><h2>Games for the Super-Intelligent</h2><p>Math, logic and word puzzles from the Masterminds in MENSA, by the author of The Complete Book of Running.</p><p></p><h2>Celebrating Christmas (St. Joseph Picture Books (Paperback))</h2><p>Teaches children the true meaning of the celebration of, Christmas.

He has written eight novels including <i>The Fuck-Up</i>, <i>Chinese Takeout</i>, <i>Manhattan Loverboy</i>, <i>Suicide Casanova</i>, <i>Dogrun</i>, and <i>Unlubricated</i>. He lives in New York City.&nbsp;When Mary Bellanova finds her live-in boyfriend, Primo, dead on the couch in her New York City apartment, she is catapulted into a manic quest for the truth about his life in this lightweight, plot-driven, downtown grunge novel. Primo was an enigmatic drifter, author of a pornographic novel and ex-lover of an eclectic collection of girlfriends; it seems he even had a child. Mary's own life is nothing to write home about. She's 29 years old and has been working a succession of temp jobs while making fitful attempts at finishing a collection of short stories. On Primo's trail, she stumbles into a series of new adventures. In search of one of Primo's many ex-girlfriends, she arrives at a band audition and accidentally becomes a bassist in an all-woman band, the Beautiful and the Crazy. Other forays land her dates with a toe-sucking foot fetishizer and a borderline rapist. Finally, she meets a marginally more suitable tattooed hipster while walking Primo's dog, Numb. Meanwhile, she is being wined and dined by Joey, an older man who once lived next door to her parents in New Jersey. As it happens, it is Joey, and not Primo, whose secrets will ultimately matter the most to Mary. As the coincidences mount, Mary tries to make sense of them, ultimately realizing that life is just "a series of battles and treaties." Nersesian (The Fuck-up) knows downtown Manhattan's East Village life better than most, and his characters are instantly recognizable, if somewhat cartoonish. But his tongue-in-cheek humor and uneven prose may limit the novel's readership to the slacker denizens it chronicles. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Continuum History of Apocalypticism</h2><p><p>"Apocalypticism has been the source of hope and courage for the oppressed, but has also given rise, on many occasions, to fanaticism and intolerance. The essays in this volume seek neither to apologize for the extravagance of apocalyptic thinkers nor to excuse the perverse actions of some of their followers.

The main historical surveys that provided the spine of the Encyclopedia have been retained, while essays of a thematic nature, and a few whose subject matter is not central to the historical development, have been omitted. The work begins with 8 articles on "The Origins of Apocalypticism in the Ancient World," extending from ancient Near Eastern myth through the Old Testament to the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jesus, Paul, and the Book of Revelation. Next are 7 articles on "Apocalyptic Traditions from Late Antiquity to ca. 1800 C.E.," including early Christian theology, radical movements in the Middle Ages, and both Jewish and Islamic apocalypticism in the classic period. The final section, "Apocalypticism in the Modern Age," includes 10 articles on apocalypticism in the Americas, in Western and Eastern Europe, and, finally, in modern Judaism and modern Islam.</p></p><p>Bernard McGinn is the Naomi Shenstone Donnelly Professor Historical Theology and the History of Christianity at the University of Chicago Divinity School.John J.

An authority on color and on Turner, he is also the author of <i>Color and Meaning: Art, Science, and Symbolism</i> (California, 1999).Color is such an integral part of our visual, emotional, and aesthetic experiences that we hardly know how to study it within a cultural context. Gage, a British art historian and an expert on color and the painter J. M. W. Turner, has written a seminal, in-depth history of the perception and use of color in Western civilization and art. Gage covers everything from theories about color's source, divinity, and meaning to the palettes of various artists and the use of color to express sound. Proceeding chronologically from the art of antiquity to twentieth-century abstract painting, Gage explains how artists in different eras perceived color and developed techniques to harness it in their work for the attainment of myriad effects. In fluid, if reference-rich and often-technical, prose, Gage analyzes the use of color in Greek sculpture, early Christian mosaics, stained-glass windows, heraldry, and the work of Titian and Leonardo da Vinci, to name just a few of this large, well-illustrated volume's dozens of challenging topics. He also tackles the theories of Newton and Goethe and discusses such trends as the Romantics' fascination with rainbows.

A memoir about Brown's adolescent sexuality and shame, <i>The Playboy</i> chronicles his teenage obsession with the magazine of the same name, but it's also a work that explores the physical form of comics to their fullest storytelling capacity. In it, a fifteen-year-old Chester is visited by a time-traveling adult Chester, and the latter narrates the former's compulsion to purchase each issue of <i>Playboy</i> as it appears on newsstands. Even more fascinating than his obsession with the magazine is his need to keep his habit secret and the resulting lengths to which he goes to avoid detection by his family and, later, his girlfriends. <br> The comics that became <i>The Playboy</i> first appeared in issues of Brown's controversial, groundbreaking comic <i>Yummy Fur</i> more than twenty years ago, and yet the frankness of the work makes it seem avant-garde even now. As in every work by this master cartoonist, <i>The Playboy</i> uses no extra words, no extra panels, no extra lines, conveying environment and emotion through perfectly chosen moments.

Fleshing out the concept, he turned the character into Mister X, a brilliant architect responsible for Radiant City. Inspired by Le Corbusier's utopian vertical metropolis, the project boasted "psychetecture" designed to positively alter its residents' mental states. But the developer cut corners, and the city instead has a deleterious, dehumanizing effect. After suffering a breakdown caused by the drug he takes to avoid sleep, Mister X returns to try to reverse the deterioration. More fun than its ponderous premise sounds, the tale is enlivened by gangsters, glamour gals, and romantic intrigue. Rather than writing and drawing it himself, Motter enlisted alternative and mainstream comics talents, including <i>Love and Rockets</i>' Hernandez brothers, <i>Sandman-</i>cover-artist Dave McKean (this was his first published comics work), and a pre-<i>Palookaville </i>Seth, who all followed Motter's general story line and visual approach.

The solution came in 1952 from one man and the road he devoted the last decade of his life to building. The man was William Callahan, and the road was the Massachusetts Turnpike. Building the Mass Pike tells the story of the road&#39;s planning, construction, and impact on the communities through which it passed. The book includes previously unpublished images from the Turnpike Authority archives and provides a vivid document of the largest public works project in the state&#39;s history and the firestorm of controversy that surrounded it. Written by an engineer-historian, Building the Mass Pike will appeal not only to those fascinated by the history of the Commonwealth and its capital but also to those with an interest in construction, urban history, and the politics of old Boston.</p><p>Yanni K.

Some did not bother to step outside. Others planned for years, reserving tickets to see the transit in its entirety. But even this group of astronomers and experience seekers were attracted not by scientific purpose but by the event's beauty, rarity, and perhaps--after this book--history. For previous sky-watchers, though, transits afforded the only chance to determine the all-important astronomical unit: the mean distance between earth and sun.</p><br><p> Eli Maor tells the intriguing tale of the five Venus transits previously observed and the fantastic efforts made to record them. This is a story of heroes and cowards, of reputations earned and squandered, all told against a backdrop of phenomenal geopolitical and scientific change.</p><br><p> With a novelist's talent for the details that keep readers reading late, Maor tells the stories of how Kepler's misguided theology led him to the laws of planetary motion; of obscure Jeremiah Horrocks, who predicted the 1639 transit only to die, at age 22, a day before he was to discuss the event with the only other human known to have seen it; of the unfortunate Le Gentil, whose decade of labor was rewarded with obscuring clouds, shipwreck, and the plundering of his estate by relatives who prematurely declared him dead; of David Rittenhouse, Father of American Astronomy, who was overcome by the 1769 transit's onset and failed to record its beginning; and of Maximilian Hell, whose good name long suffered from the perusal of his transit notes by a color-blind critic.</p><br><p> Moving beyond individual fates, Maor chronicles how governments' participation in the first international scientific effort--the observation of the 1761 transit from seventy stations, yielding a surprisingly accurate calculation of the astronomical unit using Edmund Halley's posthumous directions--intersected with the Seven Years' War, British South Seas expansion, and growing American scientific prominence. Throughout, Maor guides readers to the upcoming Venus transits in 2004 and 2012, opportunities to witness a phenomenon seen by no living person and not to be repeated until 2117.</p></p><p><p>"The book gathers much historical information not readily available, on a topic not frequently treated . . . an entertaining book, readily understandable to a general audience."--<b>Jack Zirker, author of <i>Total Eclipses of the Sun</i></b></p><p>"This is a very well-written book, providing a wealth of historical facts."--<b>Joe Rao, Hayden Planetarium</b></p><b>Eli Maor</b> teaches History of Mathematics at Loyola University in Chicago.

He believed in the Pauline principle of justification by faith. Faith is a gift from God made available to humans by the incarnation of God the Son. This led him to challenge the corruption of the Church and he became the main leader of the Protestant Reformation. This volume is a selection of recollections, by friends and family, of things Luther said informally. It is therefore not as heavily theological as his writings, but rather an easily accessible and personal account of the German Reformation. This book celebrates the atmosphere of intellectual and spiritual freedom that was found at this time. These are thoughts of Luther as he relaxed with friends, and through them we glimpse beyond the theologian to the whole man; his feelings, ideas and even his humour.</p><p>This religious classic brings to life one of the most famous leaders of the Protestant Reformation in simple conversations that reveal his personality and wisdom.Martin Luther (1483, 1546) was a German monk, a theologian and church reformer, he is considered to be the founder of Protestantism. Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>Bloodsucker Tales, Volume 1 (30 Days of Night, Book 4)</h2><p><ul> <li>The world of the undead is a vast one, with many stories remaining to be told.

It tells the stories of the great philosophers, and breathes life into their ideas, while also challenging many of our most cherished moral beliefs. Engaging and provocative, The Quest for a Moral Compass confronts some of humanity&#39;s deepest questions. Where do values come from? Is God necessary for moral guidance? Are there absolute moral truths? It also brings morality down to earth, showing how, throughout history, social needs and political desires have shaped moral thinking. It is a history of the world told through the history of moral thought, and a history of moral thought that casts new light on global history. At a time of great social turbulence and moral uncertainty, there will be few histories more important than this.</p><p>Kenan Malik is a writer, lecturer and broadcaster. He is a presenter of Analysis of BBC Radio 4, and a panelist on The Moral Maze. He has taught at universities in Britain, Europe, Australia and the USA, presented many TV documentaries and writes regularly for newspapers across the world including the New York Times, the Guardian, Goeteborgs-Posten and the Australian. His books include Man, Beast and Zombie, Strange Fruit and From Fatwa to Jihad, which was shortlisted for the 2010 Orwell Prize.The Quest for a Moral Compass is a remarkable achievement... While demonstrating genuine command of the subtleties of the hundreds of topics covered, he consistently chooses the accessible, the concise, the precise, and the broad-ranging over the technical, theoretical, and trivial. I learned more than I can say and will no doubt be consulting this book often in the future. -- Austin Dacey What I love about Kenan Malik&#39;s book is its unashamed, unabashed ambition: he wants to write the history of moral thought, not just in the Western tradition, but of all the traditions that make up the global argument about the direction that the human moral compass should point. The result is a tour de force of lucidity and narrative skill. -- Michael Ignatieff This is an extraordinarily rewarding investigation of the most striking, and contested, aspect of our humanity... To read it is not only to be better informed but also to be more alert to the assumptions that have guided human beings in the past, and to our capacity for goodness and wickedness. -- Raymond Tallis An absolute tour de force. I can imagine it replacing Bertrand Russell&#39;s History of Western Philosophy on many a bookshelf - certainly mine. -- Tom Holland</p><h2>Living on an Acre: A Practical Guide to the Self-Reliant Life</h2><p>Whether maintaining a second home, starting a part-time farm, or going back to the land, LIVING ON AN ACRE is the leading handbook for the small-scale farmer, and a comprehensive approach to solutions to every land-related problem.

For some wacky reason "Optimal Living 101" didn't make the schedule... But imagine if that class <i>did</i> exist and the teachers included everyone from the old school philosophers like Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, Emerson, Nietzsche and Buddha to modern sages like Joseph Campbell, Paulo Coelho, Dan Millman, Deepak Chopra, Byron Katie, Eckhart Tolle and Wayne Dyer plus the world's leading positive psychologists like Sonja Lyubomirsky, Tal Ben-Shahar and Martin Seligman who are *scientifically* establishing how we can live with more happiness, meaning and mojo.</p><p>Think of this book as a Philosopher's notes on that awesome class.

Japanese police superintendent Tetsuo Otani is alerted by his sister-in-law, professor Michiko Yanagida, to the strange atmosphere at the first session of the International Summer School on the Traditional Arts and Crafts of Japan, which she is attending at Anraku-in. While Otani and his wife, Hanae, meet with Michiko, gangster Keizo Hosoda celebrates his release from prison with friends. Then Minoru Kido, the Japanese head of the summer school, succumbs to the third attempt on his life and Hosoda turns up missing. Otani and his troops investigate. A good portion of the book is squandered on stilted matchmaking as Otani's men are paired with female professors at the summer school. Fans will be dismayed by the lack of actual detecting and a dearth of the insights into Japanese customs and thought that have distinguished Melville's previous books. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>This Old Souse: A Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery</h2><p><p>USA Today bestselling mystery maven Mary Daheim brings us another intriguing tale in her cherished Bed-and-Breakfast mystery series in which a trip down memory lane brings Judith and Renie back to their old neighbourhood, and they are drawn to a seemingly deserted house that is much more than meets the eye.</p><p> On a trip to Renie&#x2032;s old neighbourhood, the cousins&#x2032; curiosity is piqued by a mysterious brick Tudor house that always looked deserted during Renie&#x2032;s junior high school days. Surprised that the house still looks abandoned after all these years, Judith and Renie, of course, cannot resist an opportunity to snoop around. They discover that Mr. and Mrs. Bland have lived in the house since 1947, and after cornering the mailman and milkman, Judith and Renie also learn that the Blands receive regular mail and food deliveries, but no one has ever seen the occupants who simply pay the bills with cash they leave in the milk box. Although intrigued by these strange, but definitely not sinister, occurrences, Judith is ready to focus her attention once more on her neglected husband Joe and the busy B&amp;B business. Until one day Judith finds a dead body in the trunk of her car. And it&#x2032;s the Blands&#x2032; milkman...</p></p><p><p>Mary Richardson Daheim is a Seattle native with a communications degree from the University of Washington. Realizing at an early age that getting published in books with real covers might elude her for years, she worked on daily newspapers and in public relations to help avoid her creditors. She lives in her hometown in a century-old house not unlike Hillside Manor, except for the body count. Daheim is also the author of the Alpine mystery series, the mother of three daughters, and has three grandchildren.</p>What sets this latest entry in Daheim's Bed and Breakfast series apart is neither its plot nor its B-and-B connection. Set in the Pacific Northwest, the mystery is somewhat predictable, and very little of the action takes place in the B and B. Apparently, protagonist Judith McMonigle Flynn can run the place and take care of her crotchety mother with plenty of time left over to investigate mysteries. None of these flaws are fatal, however--far from it. Readers clearly enjoy this warm, funny, feel-good series, thanks mostly to sexagenarian sleuth Judith and her ornery cousin, Renie. When Renie convinces Judith to investigate the elderly owners of a Spanish villa, a series of misadventures ensues. First a mysterious package is left on the villa's porch. Then Judith finds a dead milkman in her trunk. With a few white lies and help from Renie, Judith tries to find out who wants to frame her for murder. A charming cozy to enjoy on a Sunday afternoon--preferably with tea and scones. <i>Jenny McLarin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Stevenson carefully weaves a detective story with the quest for human perfection gone awry to construct a tale that has haunted readers for more than a century.</p></p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

But Lucas is too little, and so he bullies the ants instead. Feature film coming Summer 2006!<br><br>Lucas is picked on by the neighborhood bully, and in turn terrorizes the ant colony. The ants create a potion that shrinks Lucas to the size of an ant. They put him on trial, and find him guilty of crimes against the colony -- his sentence? To live and work as an ant! Lucas learns about teamwork and the importance of friendship--and in the end, he saves the colony and is returned to his normal size.</p><p>Miniature worlds can be big attractions, as the films Antz and A Bug's Life show. Unfortunately, this insect adventure, concerning a boy who mistreats ants, provides no basis for its fantasy plot and evokes little sympathy for its hero. Lucas, who wears a goofy propeller cap and nerdish glasses, suffers the taunts of a tough kid named Sid. After Sid blasts him with a water hose, Lucas gets a squirt gun and does the same to a colony of ants. Alas, Lucas is no match for his would-be victims, who use a magical green potion to reduce him to their size and then sentence him to hard labor. ("Don't you realize how long and hard we work to build what you destroy in seconds?" huffs the Queen, who lounges on a pink chaise, smoking through a golden cigarette holder and nibbling gumdrops.) Once Lucas learns a lesson in community, the ants restore him to his original proportions, then devise a predictable comeuppance for his hose-toting nemesis (shrinkage, of course). Nickle's fine-line acrylic illustrations accent the slender digits and mandibles of the black ants; except for the long-lashed Queen Ant, the identical drones, wasps and spider here are painted in entomological detail. The author credibly anthropomorphizes ant societies, stressing equality and cooperation. Yet the facile conclusion denies Lucas a chance to succeed on human terms. Ages 4-7. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Lucas's funny glasses and strange hat make him a perfect target for Sid, the neighborhood bully, and, since Lucas can't fight Sid, he tortures defenseless ants instead. Then the ants retaliate, and their queen shrinks Lucas to their size, forcing him into a life of hard labor with the worker ants. When he is given the supreme test of bringing the queen a red Swell Jell candy from his home, the boy shows his true mettle, protecting his partners from being swatted by his father. In gratitude, the queen returns him to his normal size, shrinking Sid instead. With the current popularity of the animated movies Antz and A Bug's Life, this title is timed just right for success, but the book falls short. The message is certainly clear, and Nickle's full-page acrylic paintings are bright, funny, and appealing. The text, however, is only average. The sentences are choppy, lack variety in their structure, and leave out potentially interesting details. Still, since the theme of a bully's getting his comeuppance continues to appeal to youngsters, the story is a suitable additional purchase for those collections in which books such as Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's King of the Playground (Atheneum, 1991) are popular.<br><i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>MOUNTAIN LAUREL</h2><p>On the raucous American frontier, a genteel, scornful woman of class confronts a California gold miner who is accustomed to doing things his own way</p><p>Jude Deveraux is the author of&nbsp;forty-one <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including MOONLIGHT IN THE MORNING, SCENT OF JASMINE, SCARLET NIGHTS, DAYS OF GOLD, LAVENDER MORNING, RETURN TO SUMMERHOUSE, and SECRETS.

He was to remain with her and her small band of musicians and servants as long as the lady needed him. He was to protect her from any dangers she would possibly encounter on her journey and to do what he could to make her travels more comfortable. <br>Colonel Harrison put the letter down, handling it as though it were a precious relic, and smiled so broadly his face nearly cracked. Lady's maid, he thought. The high and mighty Captain: Montgomery was being ordered to be nothing more than a lady's maid. But, more important, Captain Montgomery was being ordered away from Fort Breck.<br>Colonel Harrison took a few deep, cleansing breaths and thought about having his own fort to command, and about not having to deal with the perfection, the cool knowledge of Captain Montgomery. No longer would the men look to their captain for confirmation of every order, for permission to do: what their colonel asked of them.<br>Colonel Harrison thought back to when he first came to Fort Breck a year ago. His predecessor, Colonel Collins, had been a drunken, lazy old fool. Collins's only concern had been surviving until he could retire, get out of Indian country and go back to Virginia, where people lived in a civilized manner. He was content to turn over all responsibility to his second-in-command, Captain Montgomery. And why not? Montgomery's record had to be seen to be believed. He'd been in the army since he was eighteen, and in the ensuing eight years he'd worked himself up through the ranks. He'd started as a private, and, after extraordinary heroism on the field of battle, he'd been made an officer. He'd gone from second lieutenant to captain in a mere three years, and at the rate he was going he'd outrank Colonel Harrison in another few years.<br>Not that the man didn't deserve everything he'd ever earned in the army. No, as far as Colonel Harrison could tell, Captain Montgomery was perfect. He was cool under fire, never losing his head. He was generous, fair, and understanding with the enlisted men, and as a result they pretty much thought he ran the fort. The officers went to him with their problems; the officers' ladies fawned over him and asked his advice about social events. Captain Montgomery didn't drink, didn't patronize the whores outside the fort; he'd never lost his temper as far as anyone knew, and he could do <i>anything.</i> He could ride like a demon and, while at a full gallop, shoot the eye out of a turkey from a hundred yards away. He knew Indian sign language and a smattering of several Indian languages. Hell, even the Indians liked him, said he was a man they could respect and trust. No doubt Captain Montgomery would die before he broke his word.<br>Everyone in the world seemed to like, honor, respect, even revere Captain Montgomery. Everyone, that is, except Colonel Harrison. Colonel Harrison loathed the man. Not just disliked him, not just hated him, but <i>loathed</i> him. Everything the captain could do that the colonel couldn't made the colonel despise him more. The enlisted men saw within a week after the colonel's arrival that Harrison didn't know anything about the West, and the truth was, this was the first time in his life the colonel had been west of the Mississippi. Captain Montgomery hadn't volunteered to help the colonel learn the ropes; no, he was much too polite for that, but, in the end the colonel had had to ask him some questions. The captain had always known the answer, always known the best way to settle any dispute.<br>It was after Colonel Harrison had been at Fort Breck for five months that he began to hate the man who had all the answers. Of course, having a sixteen-year-old daughter who practically swooned at the sight of the man, didn't help matters.<br>Colonel Harrison's resentment had come to a head one hot morning the previous summer when, in a vile mood, the colonel had ordered a man who had done no more than oversleep reveille to be punished with twenty lashes. He was sick unto death of the drunkenness of his men and meant to make an example of the private. He ignored the looks of hatred from the other men, but his stomach began to hurt. He wasn't a bad man; be just wanted to enforce discipline at his post.<br>When Captain Montgomery stepped forward to protest the punishment, Colonel Harrison saw red. He informed the captain that <i>he</i> was in charge of the fort, and unless the captain meant to take the man's punishment, he was to stay out of this. It wasn't until Montgomery began removing his jacket that the colonel realized what he meant to do.<br>It was the worst morning of the colonel's life, and he dearly wished he could go back to bed and start the day over. Captain Montgomery -- the fearless, perfect Captain Montgomery took all twenty of the man's lashes. For a while the colonel thought he was going to have a mutiny on his hands when all the enlisted men refused to wield the whip. In the end a second lieutenant applied the whip to Montgomery's broad back, and when he was finished he threw the whip into the dirt and turned on the colonel, his eyes blazing with hatred. "Anything else...<i>sir?"</i> he'd asked, sneering the last word.<br>For two weeks hardly anyone on the post spoke to the colonel -- including his own wife and daughter. As for the captain, he was back on duty the next morning without so much as a grimace of pain for a back that must have been killing him. That he wouldn't even commit himself to the infirmary for a few days was the last straw. From that day on, Colonel Harrison didn't even bother trying to conceal his loathing for the captain. Of course the captain never once betrayed what he felt for the colonel; no, perfect human beings like Montgomery don't give away what they feel. He just continued to be the perfect officer a friend to the men, a charming escort to the ladies. A man trusted by all. A man who, as far as Colonel Harrison could tell, had no feelings. A man who never woke up on the wrong side of the bed. A man who never tripped on his horse's stirrup or missed whatever he was aiming to shoot. A man who would probably smile in the face of death.<br>But now, Colonel Harrison thought, now he was going to get rid of this perfect man. Now General Yovington had requested an escort for some opera singer through gold country, and he was going to send the illustrious Captain Montgomery. "I hope she's fat," the colonel said aloud. "I hope she's <i>real</i> fat."<br>"Sir?" his corporal asked from his desk on the other side of the room.<br>"Nothing," the colonel barked. "Send Captain Montgomery to me, then leave us." The colonel ignored the look the corporal gave him.<br>Promptly, as always, Captain Montgomery appeared and the colonel tried to keep from frowning. There wasn't a speck of dust on the captain's dark blue uniform, which he suspected had been privately tailored to fit the captain's six-foot-three-inch frame.<br>"You wanted to see me, sir?" Captain Montgomery asked, standing at attention.<br>Colonel Harrison wondered if the man <i>could</i> slump. "I have orders for you from General Yovington. Ever hear of him?"<br>"Yes, sir."<br>What had the colonel expected, that Montgomery <i>didn't</i> know the answer to something? He rose from behind his desk, put his hands behind his back, and began to walk about the room. He must try to keep the joy from his voice. "As you know, General Yovington is a very important man and he has reasons for what he does. He does not allow people like you and me to know those reasons, but then, you and I are mere soldiers and ours is to obey, not to question the reason behind an order." He looked at the captain. There was no impatience on his face, no annoyance, just that calm look he always wore. Perhaps the colonel could break that perfect calm. He'd give a month's pay to be able to do that.<br>The colonel went to the desk and picked up the letter. "I received this by special courier this morning. It seems to be of utmost importance. The general, for whatever reasons, seems to have formed an, ah...attachment to an opera singer and now that...lady wants to sing for the gold miners. He wants her to have an army escort."<br>The colonel looked hard at Captain Montgomery, his eyes wide, for he didn't want to miss the man's reaction. "The general requested Lieutenant Surrey, but as you well know, the poor unfortunate man won't be able to make it, therefore I've thought long and hard about a suitable replacement, and I have chosen you, Captain."<br>Colonel Harrison almost did a little jump of joy when Montgomery blinked twice and then tightened his lips. "You're to keep her out of trouble, see that the Indians don't bother her, keep the miners from making advances toward her, see that she's comfortable. I guess that means see that's she's fed and that her bath water's hot and -- "<br>"I respectfully decline the assignment, sir," Captain Montgomery said, his back straight, his eyes straight ahead, which was some inches over the colonel's graying head.<br>Colonel Harrison's heart swelled. "This is not a request, it's an order. You are not being asked, you are being told. It is not an invitation you can refuse."<br>To the colonel's astonishment, Montgomery dropped his rigid posture and, without being given permission, he sat down in a chair, then withdrew a thin cigar from inside his jacket. "An opera singer? What the hell do I know about an opera singer?"<br>The colonel knew he should reprimand the captain for sitting without permission, but if he'd learned nothing else in the last year, he'd at least learned that the western army was not like in the East, where discipline was understood. Besides, he was enjoying the perfect captain's consternation too much.<br>"Oh, come now, Captain, you can figure it out. Who better than you? Why, in all my twenty years of service I've never seen a man with a better record. Commissioned on the field of battle, an indispensable right-hand man to any officer. You've fought Indians and whites, You've rounded up outlaws and renegades. You're a man's man and yet you can advise the ladies on how to set a table, and according to what I hear from the ladies, you dance divinely." He smiled when Captain Montgomery gave him a malevolent look. He hadn't broken that facade even on the day he'd taken the twenty lashes for the private.<br>"What's Yovington to her?"<br><i>"General</i> Yovington didn't make me his confidant. He merely sent his orders. You're to leave in the morning. As far as I can tell, the woman has already reached the mountains on her own. You'll recognize her by..." He picked up the letter, trying hard to conceal his smile. "She's traveling in a modified Concord wagon. It's red and it has, ah...let's see, the name LaReina painted on the side. LaReina is the woman's name. I hear she's very good. At singing, I mean. I don't know what else she's good at besides singing. The general didn't tell me that."<br>"She's traveling in a stagecoach?"<br>"A red one." Colonel Harrison permitted himself a small smile. "Oh, come now, Captain, surely this isn't a <i>bad</i> assignment. Think how this will look on your record. Think where this could lead. If you perform this duty well, you could start escorting generals' daughters. I'm sure my own daughter would give you a recommendation."<br>Abruptly, Captain Montgomery stood. "With all due respect, sir, I cannot do this. There is too much unrest now and I am needed elsewhere. There are white settlers to protect, and what with this slavery controversy and the possibility of war, I do not believe I can desert my post to -- "<br>Colonel Harrison lost his sense of humor. "Captain, this is <i>not</i> a request. This is an order. Whether you like it or not, you are on an assignment of indefinite length. You are to stay with this woman as long as she wants, go wherever she wants, do whatever needs to be done, even if it is no more than pull her coach out of the mud. If you don't do this, I will slap you in jail, court-martial you, find you guilty, and have you shot, And if I have to, I'll pull the trigger myself. Is that understood? Do I make myself clear?"<br>"Very clear, sir," Captain Montgomery answered tightly.<br>"All right, then, go and pack. You're to leave at dawn tomorrow." The colonel watched as the captain seemed to be trying to say something. "What is it?" he snapped.<br>"Toby," was all the captain could get out through a jaw tight with anger.<br>So, the captain <i>did</i> have a temper, the colonel thought, and he was tempted to antagonize him further by insisting that the orders had not included the garrulous, scrawny little private who was never more than a few feet from the captain's side. But the colonel remembered too well the anger of the enlisted men the day the captain had taken an enlisted man's lashes. "Take him," the colonel said. "He'll be of no use here."<br>The captain nodded his thanks but didn't speak them as he turned on his heel and left the colonel's office.<br>After the captain was gone, the colonel sank onto his hard chair and let out a sigh of relief, but at the same time he was a little nervous. Could he control this unruly fort, where most of the "soldiers" were farmers who'd signed up merely to fill their bellies? Half of them were drunk most of the time, and desertion was rampant. For the last year his record had been excellent, but he knew that was due a great deal to Captain Montgomery. Could he rule the fort on his own?<br>"Damn him!" he said, and slammed a desk drawer shut in anger. Of course he could command his own fort!<br><br>'Ring Montgomery stared at the woman through the spyglass for a long moment, then angrily slammed it closed.<br>"That her?" Toby asked from behind him. "You sure she's the one?" He was a foot shorter than 'Ring, wiry, and had skin the color of walnut juice.<br>"How many other women would be fool enough to travel alone to a town of forty thousand men?"<br>Toby took the spyglass and looked through it. They were standing on a hill looking down into a pretty valley where a bright new red stagecoach sat, glittering in the setting sun, a tent not far away. In front of the coach was a woman sitting at a table, slowly eating her dinner while a thin, blonde woman served her.<br>Toby lowered the glass. "What d'you think she's eatin'? It looks like somethin' green on her plate. Do you think it's peas? Maybe string beans. Or is it just green meat like the army has?"<br>"I couldn't care less what she's eating. Damn Harrison! Damn him to hell and back! Incompetent bastard! Just because he can't run a fort the size of Breck, he sends me off to do his dirty work."<br>Toby yawned. He'd heard this a thousand times. He'd been with 'Ring since 'Ring was a boy, and he might seem stoic to others but Toby knew the truth. "You oughta be thankin' the man. He got us out of that godforsaken fort and put us out here where the gold's ours to be had."<br>"We have an assignment, and I mean to fulfill it."<br><i>"You</i> is right. I ain't part of the army."<br>'Ring started to remind Toby of the uniform he wore, but he knew it ...</p><h2>Slayers Text, Vol. 4: The Battle of Saillune</h2><p>Working as guards, Lina and Gourry travel to Saillune City, where they try to protect Prince Philionel from assassination.</p><p></p><h2>Empire in Black &amp; Gold: Shadows of the Apt. Book One</h2><p><p>Seventeen years ago Stenwold witnessed the Wasp Empire storming the city of Myna in a brutal war of conquest. Since then he has preached vainly against this threat in his home city of Collegium, but now the Empire is on the march, with its spies and its armies everywhere, and the Lowlands lie directly in its path. All the while, Stenwold has been training youthful agents to fight the Wasp advance, and the latest recruits include his niece, Che, and his mysterious ward, Tynisa. When his home is violently attacked, he is forced to send them ahead of him and, hotly pursued, they fly by airship to Helleron, the first city in line for the latest Wasp invasion.</p><p>Stenwold and Che are Beetle-kinden, one of many human races that take their powers and inspiration each from a totem insect, but he also has allies of many breeds: Mantis, Spider, Ant, with their own particular skills. Foremost is the deadly Mantis-kinden warrior, Tisamon, but other very unlikely allies also join the cause. As things go from bad to worse amid escalating dangers, Stenwold learns that the Wasps intend to use the newly completed railroad between Helleron and Collegium to launch a lightning strike into the heart of the Lowlands. Then he gathers all of his agents to force a final showdown in the engine yard...</p></p><p><p>Adrian Tchaikovsky, born in Lincolnshire, studied zoology and psychology at Reading, before practising law in Leeds.</p>On a world populated by human-insect and human-arachnid creatures, each type of kinden has special powers and aptitudes. The otherwise average Stenwold Maker, a Beetle kinden, is caught up in extraordinary times, full of violence and impending war with the Wasps. He takes it upon himself to create a small cadre of resistance fighters before it is too late. Unfortunately, he&#x2019;s considered a crackpot, those in power ignore. But he spins his web and becomes a spymaster, doing his best to prepare for the onslaught he anticipates. Each person selected for his group has a tale, and Tchaikovsky develops each slowly, drawing the reader into the lives of each and hinting that there is more to discover. There is a continual sense of urgency and danger, yet there is also time for love and friendship. The story is quickly paced, more than keeps one&#x2019;s interest, and leaves one looking forward to the next book of Shadows of the Apt to learn more about the characters and how the conflict develops. --Rebecca Gerber</p><h2>The Bull Terrier (Best Of Breed)</h2><p>The Bull Terrier is one of the most popular breeds of dog, and here at last is a book to do it justice.

Particularly appealing are "The Thornwalker and the Wolf," "The Dammsel," and "The Ruffian and the Giant." As in the rest of his creations, McKiernan employs classic fantasy elements, using them better in each new work.

The losers in this economic polarization include women, racial minorities, young people, single-parent families. Phillips demonstrates that deregulation has especially hurt organized labor, poorer city neighborhoods, people in small towns and rural areas. His analysis linking Reaganism to America's global loss of economic power is compelling. While George Bush keeps "imitating Ike in the 1990s" and refuses to develop a national strategy, post-Reagan Democrats take the blame for failure to resuscitate liberal economic populism. A stunning refutation of George Gilder's Wealth and Poverty , Phillips's dispassionate report offers no solutions yet zeroes in on key problems. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this extremely readable description of the economic consequences of the "Reagan revolution" of the 1980s, Phillips relies on diverse empirical data to support the notion that there is a cyclical pattern in American politics. Like the 1880s and the 1920s, the 1980s, says Phillips, represented the ascendancy of the Republican party, which allowed the wealthy to make even further dramatic gains over the middle and lower classes. This "circulation of elites" notion points to a populist backlash and possible return of the Democratic party to the presidency in the 1990s, he says. His critique fits nicely with the work of Arthur M. Schlesinger and the pioneering turn-of-the-century European social scientists Roberto Michels and Vilfredo Pareto.<br><i>- William D.

A sandhog, he burrows beneath the East River, digging the tunnel that will carry trains from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Above ground, the sandhogs--black, white, Irish, Italian--keep their distance from each other until a spectacular accident welds a bond between Walker and his fellow diggers--a bond that will bless and curse the next three generations. Years later, Treefrog, a homeless man driven below by a shameful secret, ures a punishing winter in his subway nest. In tones ranging from bleak to disturbingly funny, Treefrog recounts his strategies of survival--killing rats, scavenging for discarded soda cans, washing in the snow. Between Nathan Walker and Treefrog stretch seventy years of ill-fated loves and uninted crimes. In a triumph of plotting, the two stories fuse to form a tale of family, race, and redemption that is as bold and fabulous as New York City itself. In This Side of Brightness, Colum McCann confirms his place in the front ranks of modern writers.<br></p><p><i>This Side of Brightness</i> weaves historical fact with fictional truth, creating a remarkable tale of death, racism, homelessness--and yes, love--spanning four generations. Two characters dominate Colum McCann's narrative: Treefrog, a homeless man with a dark and shameful secret, and Nathan Walker, a black man who came north in the early years of the century to work as a "sandhog," digging the subway tunnels beneath Manhattan. Tunneling is perhaps the most dangerous occupation a man could have; in the close, dark, and dangerous pits far beneath the city streets, differences such as color or ethnic background cease to matter, and Walker soon becomes friends with his crewmates: two Irishmen and an Italian. Then an explosion in one of the tunnels literally blows Walker and three other men up through the earth and into the East River. Walker survives, but his best friend Con O'Leary is never found. Leary leaves behind a wife and young daughter whom Walker marries many years later. <p> Walker's tale is told in alternating chapters with Treefrog's, who, before his slide into homelessness, chose a hazardous profession--this one high up in the bright sunlight--as a construction worker building skyscrapers. But madness has brought Treefrog out of the light and back to the tunnels that Walker helped dig as he scrapes out a meager existence among the drug addicts, alcoholics, prostitutes, and petty criminals that make up the homeless community. But the grimness of McCann's tale is leavened by the beauty of his prose and the intimations all through the book that, even on this side of darkness, redemption is possible.</p>Colum McCann is the author of&nbsp; books including <i>This Side of Brightness</i>, <i>Zoli</i>, <i>Songdogs</i> and <i>Let the Great World Spin</i>.

One of the Vietnam War&#x2019;s farthest reaching legacies was the Agent Orange case. In this unprecedented personal injury class action, veterans charge that a valuable herbicide, indiscriminately sprayed on the luxuriant Vietnam jungle a generation ago, has now caused cancers, birth defects, and other devastating health problems. Peter Schuck brilliantly recounts the gigantic confrontation between two million ex-soldiers, the chemical industry, and the federal government. From the first stirrings of the lawyers in 1978 to the court plan in 1985 for distributing a record $200 million settlement, the case, which is now on appeal, has extended the frontiers of our legal system in all directions.</p><p>In a book that is as much about innovative ways to look at the law as it is about the social problems arising from modern science, Schuck restages a sprawling, complex drama. The players include dedicated but quarrelsome veterans, a crusading litigator, class action organizers, flamboyant trial lawyers, astute court negotiators, and two federal judges with strikingly different judicial styles. High idealism, self-promotion, Byzantine legal strategies, and judicial creativity combine in a fascinating portrait of a human struggle for justice through law.</p><p>The Agent Orange case is the most perplexing and revealing example until now of a new legal genre: the mass toxic tort. Such cases, because of their scale, cost, geographical and temporal dispersion, and causal uncertainty, present extraordinarily difficult challenges to our legal system. They demand new approaches to procedure, evidence, and the definition of substantive legal rights and obligations, as well as new roles for judges, juries, and regulatory agencies. Schuck argues that our legal system must be redesigned if it is to deal effectively with the increasing number of chemical disasters such as the Bhopal accident, ionizing radiation, asbestos, DES, and seepage of toxic wastes. He imaginatively reveals the clash between our desire for simple justice and the technical demands of a complex legal system.</p></p><p>Peter H. Schuck is Simeon E.

Our beliefs are challenged from many directions. Every day it seems more difficult to explain to our friends, families and neighbors what we believe and why. When our ideas and arguments fail to persuade them, what then? Is there another approach we can take? In <em>The God Conversation</em> veteran apologists and communicators J. P. Moreland and Tim Muehlhoff say that often the best way to win over others is with a good story. Stories have the ability to get behind our preconceptions and defenses. They can connect both emotionally and intellectually, appealing to the whole person rather than just to the mind. How do we defend belief in a good God in the face of terrorist attacks or natural disasters? What can we say to show we are not arrogant to believe that Jesus is the only way with so many sincere people following other world religions? What if they think we are naive to say Jesus actually rose from the dead? And when they seem confident in their right to choose their own ethical stances, how can we help them appreciate the value of a universal standard of right and wrong found in the Bible? The authors offer a wealth of penetrating illustrations, examples and quotes that respond to these issues and more. In these pages they enhance the logic and evidence found in other books defending the faith, with things that your friends, relatives or coworkers will ponder long after a conversation is over. Here is sound, empathetic coaching for those of us who long to communicate our faith more effectively.</p><p>J. P.

That's what I love about Tim Muehlhoff and J. P. Moreland's book, <em>The God Conversation</em>. This is not just a book full of stories. Rather, it's a book aimed at making us storytellers. So sit back and relax. And enjoy the journey, as you are about to learn from two master storytellers the art of turning black and white to color." (Bobby Conway, founder and host of The One Minute Apologist)<br><br>"Most conversations, let alone ones about God, are either dull, single-sided or competing monologues full of smoke. It simply shouldn't be. Carrying on a vital, passionate, engaging conversation with another human being is an art that has been sufficiently lost that we need wisdom and perspective on how to engage well. <em>The God Conversation</em> is a gift to the church to invigorate our conversations with believers, seekers and unbelievers. J. P. and Tim walk with us through the use of story and authenticity with such masterful delight that one ends by sensing the authors have given us the very gift we are to give to others." (Dan B. Allender, Ph.D., author of The Wounded Heart and To Be Told)<br><br>"If you are a headhunting evangelist or an intellectual who must have the last word, put this book down and go home. If you love your pre-Christian friends and want stimulating resources to engage them in meaningful spiritual dialogue on hard questions, J. P. and Tim are the mentors you seek." (Dr. Fred H. Wevodau, Director, U.S. Metro Mission, The Navigators)<br><br>"Today's culture is increasingly a story-based culture. As Tim and J. P. help to show, a story-based culture does not have to be a culture without truth. This book is an excellent tool to learn how to better communicate the great truths about God, the world, our faith and human nature through stories, modern-day parables, and by listening and teaching like Jesus. It is a must-read for all who want to help others find faith in Jesus Christ." (Alan Andrews, U.S. President, The Navigators)<br><br>"I love stories and illustrations because of the impact they have had on me. If they have had a similar effect on you, this book is for you. It will reinforce your faith, hone your ability to share your relationship to Jesus Christ and delight your imagination. I cannot give it a higher recommendation." (Clyde Cook, former president, Biola University)<br><br>"Moreland and Muehlhoff have written a unique and engaging book. The style is casual, yet the topics are treated with sufficient detail and nuance to be helpful. I commend <em>The God Conversation</em> to anyone seeking to discuss these matters in meaningful ways with family, friends and colleagues." (Stan W. Wallace, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Faculty Ministry &amp; Emerging Scholars Network, National Director)<br><br>"The stories are memorable and thought provoking, and the clever writing brings out the authors' message. This is a well-written guidebook for evangelizing the curious and responding to skeptics." (Church Libraries, Spring 2008)<br><br>"<em>The God Conversation</em> offers user-friendly help in countering objections to the faith."

When they finally meet their lion, they have to run, run, run through it all again to get back home. </p><p>Young readers will enjoy the playful language and beautiful paintings that reset a familiar story in an unusual and very special part of the world.</p></p><p><p><b>David Axtell</b> is a freelance artist who works with oil on canvas board. His first book for children was <i>Fruits: A Caribbean Counting Poem</i>. Mr. Axtell was born Oxford, England and currently resides in Cornwall.</p>PreSchool-Axtell takes a storytime classic to the African savanna, where loving sisters enjoy a day's adventure. With fruit, juice, and teddy bear in hand, they travel through towering green grasses under the watchful eye of a giraffe, swim through a dappled blue lake with zebras and a flamingo, and pull each other through a squishy swamp unbeknownst to a hippopotamus. They wake the lion sleeping in his cave, and as he follows them, they arrive home and shut the door safely. The adventure has neither dampened their spirits nor muddied their white anklets. Axtell's sun-soaked, impressionistic oil paintings offer beautiful landscapes and engaging details, from wild animals who linger at a safe distance, to a dropped teddy that is retrieved just in time.

Their true and terrible stories are included in <i>Troopers with Custer</i>. Some of the veterans who corresponded with E. A. Brininstool were still alive when his book first appeared in a shortened version in 1925. It has long been recognized as classic Custeriana. <p>More incisively than many later writers, Brininstool considers the causes of Custer's defeat and questions the alleged cowardice of Major Marcus A. Reno. His exciting reenactment of the Battle of the Little Big Horn sets up the reader for a series of turns by its stars and supporting and bit players. Besides the boy general with the golden locks, they include Captain Frederick W. Benteen, the scouts Lieutenant Charles A. Varnum and "Lonesome Charley" Reynolds, the trumpeter John Martin, officers and troopers in the ranks who miraculously escaped death, the only surviving surgeon and the captain of the steamboat that carried the wounded away, the newspaperman who spread the news to the world, and many others.</p></p><p>No one survived in Custer&#39;s immediate command, but other soldiers fighting in the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25-26, 1876, were doomed to remember the nightmarish scene for decades after.

How can we build a new inner strength that shines through in our outward character and relationships? Our own efforts to rise above are ineffective but by applying the power of God&#x2019;s Word we can close the gap between our reality and our beliefs. Each daily reading in Victorious Living offers essential truths and eternal principles: keys to victorious living in the circumstances we encounter every day! Victorious Living is a devotional classic written in 1936 by E. Stanley Jones, the greatest Christian leader of his day. Now this vibrant work is making a long-deserved comeback, updated for the twenty-first century by noted editor Dean Merrill.</p><p>In 1938, TIME magazine called E. Stanley Jones "the world&#x2019;s greatest missionary." Standing-room-only crowds filled his meeting halls on four different continents. He is reported to have preached more times than any human being (est. 60,000). Listeners came to Christ on nearly every occasion and some consider him "the Billy Graham of India."

The goal: for him (and readers) to "retell" childhood experiences so that "later on, our stories can end more happily than they began." Born an only child in a Jewish section in the Bronx, Kopp forever disappointed his mother and his father acquiesced in his wife's berating attitude. Kopp believed he was basically bad, and he notes that "in retrospect it seems that being 'bad' merely meant expressing my feelings of my own. I was not to be obviously beyond parental control." He recounts a stormy adolescence, difficult schooling (when he achieved much but was nonetheless dissatisfied), his troublesome early career years, his ongoing struggle with a brain tumor. Except for some choppy writing and inexplicably fleeting references to early girlfriends and his wife, this is a considered, inspiring book. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Leading Facts of New Mexican History, Vol II (Softcover) (Southwest Heritage)</h2><p>Historians have long admired Ralph Emerson Twitchell's <i>The Leading Facts of New Mexican History</i>, considered the first major history of the state. Put succinctly by former State Historian Robert J. Torrez, Twitchell's work (of which this is one of the first two volumes Sunstone Press is reprinting in its Southwest Heritage Series) has ''become the standard by which all subsequent books on New Mexico history are measured.'' As Twitchell wrote in the preface of his first volume, his goal in writing <i>The Leading Facts</i> was to respond to the ''pressing need'' for a history of New Mexico with a commitment to ''accuracy of statement, simplicity of style, and impartiality of treatment.''</p><p>Ralph Emerson Twitchell was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on November 29, 1859. Arriving in New Mexico when he was twenty-three, he immediately became involved in political and civic activities. In 1885 he helped organize a new territorial militia in Santa Fe and saw active duty in western New Mexico. Later appointed judge advocate of the Territorial Militia, he attained the rank of colonel, a title he was proud to use for the rest of his life. By 1893 he was elected the mayor of Santa Fe and, thereafter, district attorney of Santa Fe County. Twitchell probably promoted New Mexico as much as any single New Mexican of his generation. An avid supporter of New Mexico statehood, he argued the territory&#39;s case for elevated political status, celebrated its final victory in 1912, and even designed New Mexico&#39;s first state flag in 1915. Just as Twitchell&#39;s first edition in 1912 helped celebrate New Mexico&#39;s entry into statehood in 1912, the newest edition of the text and illustrations serves as a tribute to the state&#39;s centennial celebration of 2012. In the apt words of an editorial in the &#39;&#39;Santa Fe New Mexican&#39;&#39; at the time of Twitchell&#39;s death in 1925: &#39;&#39;As press agent for the best things of New Mexico, her traditions, history, beauty, glamour, scenery, archaeology, and material resources, he was indefatigable and efficient.&#39;&#39;</p><h2>Nurturing Silence in a Noisy Heart</h2><p>How can we find serenity in the midst of so much noise without and within?

But despite the Rose's power and influence as a Peer of the Empire, powerful forces move against them both, intent on capturing Rossamund and destroying Europe in the process.

The author laces his rococo but fluent narrative with moral and ethical conundrums, twists both terrible and tongue in cheek, startling revelations about humans and monsters alike and sturdy themes of loyalty, courage and selfrealization" - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review</p><p>D.M. Cornish was born in time to see the first Star Wars movie. He was five. It made him realize that worlds beyond his own were possible, and he failed to eat his popcorn. Experiences with C.S. Lewis, and later J.R.R. Tolkien, completely convinced him that other worlds existed, and that writers had a key to these worlds. But words were not yet his earliest tools for storytelling. Drawings were.<p>He spent most of his childhood drawing, as well as most of his teenage and adult years as well. And by age eleven he had made his first book, called "Attack from Mars." It featured Jupitans and lots and lots of drawings of space battles. (It has never been published and world rights are still available.)</p><p>He studied illustration at the University of South Australia, where he began to compile a series of notebooks, beginning with #1 in 1993. He had read Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels, The Iliad, and Paul Gallico's Love of Seven Dolls. Classical ideas as well as the great desire to continue what Mervyn Peake had begun but not finished led him to delineate his own world. Hermann Hesse, Kafka and other writers convinced him there were ways to be fantastical without conforming to the generally accepted notions of fantasy. Over the next ten years he filled 23 journals with his pictures, definitions, ideas and histories of his world, the Half-Continent.</p><p>It was not until 2003 that a chance encounter with a children's publisher gave him an opportunity to develop these ideas further. Learning of his journals, she bullied him into writing a story from his world. Cornish was sent away with the task of delivering 1,000 words the following week and each week thereafter. Abandoning all other paid work, he spent the next two years propped up with one small advance after the other as his publisher tried desperately to keep him from eating his furniture. </p><p>And so Rossamund's story was born - a labor of love over twelve years in the making.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Prayer (KJV): The Preacher's Outline &amp; Sermon Bible (The Preacher's Outline &amp; Sermon Bible Studies)</h2><p>Prayer is an intimate conversation with God.

Men in the armed forces were not easily accepting women in the days of challenge and change in the 1970s. Some officers and enlisted men, even among the chaplaincy, refused to respect women chaplains. Both officers and men sometimes mocked, demeaned and threatened Horton in her work of comforting army personnel, uplifting morale and conducting Christian religious services. Being in the small Christian Science denomination did not help things for this woman, who, unusually for a woman, prevailed and achieved the rank of colonel. This really is the story of how deep faith in the promises of the Gospel and the idea of unselfish service, patience, and smart and capable performance changed minds and hearts of many in the military. Pioneers often have to run races and climb hurdles; this is that story told in a winning and inspiring way. Janet Horton was present at the Pentagon on 9/11 and was part of a chaplains&#39; team which prayed with victims, aided families, and accompanied the mortuary squad into the building, thus honoring her fellow soldiers in an unforgettable way.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Eyewitnesses: Children of the Holocaust Speak (Volume 1) (Jewish Lives)</h2><p>These testimonies, submitted by individual authors and not originally intended for publication, were assembled as a historical record by the Association of the Children of the Holocaust in Poland.

Since her first SF novels were published in the 1940s, her adventure SF has enthralled readers young and old. With series such as<i> Time Traders, Solar Queen, Forerunner, Beast Master, Crosstime, </i>and <i>Janus</i>, as well as many stand-alone novels, her tales of action and adventure throughout the galaxy have drawn countless readers to science fiction. <br><br>Her fantasy, including the best-selling <i>Witch World</i> series, her "Magic" series, and many other unrelated novels, has been popular with readers for decades. Lauded as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, she is the recipient of a Life Achievement Award from the World Fantasy Convention. Not only have her books been enormously popular; she also has inspired several generations of SF and fantasy writers, especially many talented women writers who have followed in her footsteps. In the past two decades she has worked with other writers on a number of novels. Most notable among these are collaborations with Mercedes Lackey, the <i>Halfblood Chronicles,</i> as well as collaborations with A.C.

The events of each lush and sensuous novel are seen through the eyes of the central character L.G. Darley, who observes the interactions of his lovers, friends, and acquaintances. Balthazar, named for Darley&#39;s friend, a doctor and mystic, interprets Darley&#39;s views from a philosophical and intellectual viewpoint.</p><p>Lawrence Durrell was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first literary work, The Black Book, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, A Private Country, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: Prospero&#39;s Cell, Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes, and Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, which he completed in southern France where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. Caesar&#39;s Vast Ghost, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, appeared a few days before his death in Sommieres in 1990.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with JUSTINE, MOUNTOLIVE, and CLEA.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

These were the structures about which I played as a boy, and about which I stroll in my imagination today. This book is about what Nebraska means to me, one man who grew up there, and I&#39;ve tried to make it a work of reverence.&#34; The scenes included here portray the originality and vitality and strength of the state&#39;s carpenters, architects, buildings stand in the shade of the wrecking crane. &#34;Perhaps by calling attention to these magnificent and irreplaceable structures, I can help to preserve them,&#34; Hanna says. For others it is too late: &#34;I looked at them once, scratched out my drawing, and when I looked back they had disappeared, destroyed by fire or weather or the wrecking crew. Only my sketches and the memories of local townspeople persist to substantiate the existence of many of the places you&#39;ll see in these pages.&#34; A native of Ewing, Nebraska, Robert Hanna holds a degree in architecture from the University of Nebraska and has maintained an architectural practice in Lincoln since 1968.

The popularity of the TV programs inspired Francis Durbridge to write several novels featuring the easygoing engineer turned spy Tim Frazer. In this one, read by <i>Buffy</i> and <i>Little Britain</i> star Anthony Head, Frazer becomes involved in another complex case full of twists and turns. St. Bride's guest house, just outside the town of Melinfforest, was a restful place with glorious views of the Welsh countryside. Tim Frazer, however, had no time for fishing and long country walks. He had been sent there to find out why Miss Thackery, a British intelligence agent, had been brutally murdered and her body dumped in a nearby wood. There was also the matter of a missing German scientist, Kurt Lander, who had been working for the British Government before mysteriously disappearing. Can Tim Frazer find out what links the two agents&#x2014;before it's too late?</p><p>Francis Durbridge (1912&#x2013;1998) penned his first detective novel at the age of twenty&#x2013;two and went on to write three dozen more. Many of his novels and plays were broadcast on radio and television, and Detective Paul Temple was his most popular character, prompting twenty&#x2013;one series broadcast over a period of thirty years.<br></p><h2>Blood on the Snow: The Carpathian Winter War of 1915 (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>The Carpathian campaign of 1915, described by some as the "Stalingrad of the First World War," engaged the million-man armies of Austria-Hungary and Russia in fierce winter combat that drove them to the brink of annihilation. Habsburg forces fought to rescue 130,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers trapped by Russian troops in Fortress Przemysl, but the campaign was waged under such adverse circumstances that it produced six times as many casualties as the number besieged. It remains one of the least understood and most devastating chapters of the war-a horrific episode only glimpsed previously but now vividly restored to the annals of history by Graydon Tunstall.<br><br>The campaign, consisting of three separate and ultimately doomed offensives, was the first example of "total war" conducted in a mountainous terrain, and it prepared the way for the great battle of Gorlice-Tarnow. Habsburg troops under Conrad von Htzendorf faced those of General Nikolai Ivanov, which together totaled more than two million soldiers. None of the participants were psychologically or materially prepared to engage in prolonged winter mountain warfare, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers suffered from frostbite or succumbed to the "White Death." Tunstall reconstructs the brutal environment-heavy snow, ice, dense fog, frigid winds-to depict fighting in which a man lasted on average between five to six weeks before he was killed, wounded, captured, or committed suicide. Meanwhile, soldiers warmed rifles over fires to make them operable and slaughtered thousands of horses just to ward off starvation.<br><br>This riveting depiction of the Carpathian Winter War is the first book-length account of that vicious campaign, as well as the first English-language account of Eastern Front military operations in World War I in more than thirty years. Based on exhaustive research in Vienna's and Budapest's War Archives, Tunstall's gripping narrative incorporates material drawn from eyewitness accounts, personal diaries, army logbooks, and correspondence among members of the high command.<br><br>As Tunstall shows, the roots of the Habsburg collapse in Russia in 1916 lay squarely in the winter campaign of 1915. Packed with insights from previously unexploited primary sources, his book provides an engrossing read&#x2014;and the definitive account of the Carpathian Winter War.<br></p><p>"With bold, powerful brush strokes, Tunstall paints a picture of horrendous death in the Carpathian Mountains. Austria-Hungary and Russia each lost about one million men, making the battle more costly than the better known ones of Verdun and the Somme 1916. Meticulously researched and well written, this is military history at its finest. A must read."--Holger H. Herwig, author of <i>The Marne, 1914</i><p> </p><p>"Snow falls on the mountains, wolves howl in the distance, and two doomed armies learn the truth of the old adage, 'there is no enemy more formidable than nature.' An essential book for all World War I libraries."--Robert M. Citino, author of <i>The German Way of War</i></p>Graydon A. Tunstall teaches history at the University of South Florida and is executive director of the Phi Alpha Theta history honor society. He is author of World War I and its Effects upon World History, Planning for War against Russia and Serbia: Austro-Hungarian and German Military Strategies, 1871-1914, and a forthcoming volume on Fortress Przemysl.</p><h2>Starting From Scratch</h2><p><br><i>My name is Avery King and I&#x2019;m probably a lot like you.

In <b>Awakening the Buddhist Heart</b> Surya Das shows you how to reach inward and outward. <br><br>By developing spiritual intelligence, a sense of compassion that helps us be more sensitive, more aware of our own feelings and the feelings of those around us, we become more intuitive; we relate better and love better. Cultivating spiritual intelligence and learning how to connect will improve our capacity for intimacy, making us better mates, friends, parents, and coworkers; it helps all of us to become more giving and brings us fulfillment, meaning, and love. <br><br>Using down-to-earth, everyday experiences and stories, as well as specific ancient Buddhist practices and meditations, Surya Das illustrates how to develop authentic presence, how to connect to our own life experience, build deeper relationships, embrace life's lessons, as well as learn how to love what we don't like. With tremendous insight he explores specific ways in which we can more fruitfully relate to our own experiences as well as each other in today's fast-paced, complicated, and often confusing world.<br><br>Surya Das also includes his translation of the rare and invaluable Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva-a timeless, legendary Tibetan text, along with his commentary. These practices for self-reflection help us think about how we live our lives and the lessons we can learn from mindfulness, love, and compassion.</p><p>Surya Das's breezy delivery makes his teachings come off like colorful conversation. In the third installment of his bestselling "Awakening" series, America's most popular lama shows us how to integrate inner and outer practices. Our inner spirituality, he says, can never be separate from our relationships with others. With his trademark clarity, he integrates his teachings with light- hearted anecdotes and down-to-earth practices. Basic meditation, for instance, can help us create a gap between our knee-jerk judgments and our reactions, allowing for calm, wise relations. Likewise, one can try authentic listening ("opening the third ear") or exploiting the power of speech to build deeper connections. And beyond human relations lies our connection to the natural world, for which Surya Das also includes a few lovely meditations. Taking that extra step in our practice from the self to the world requires more than just individual persistence, it takes compassion and teaches more than you'd expect. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Advance Praise For Awakening the Buddhist Heart<br><br>"Surya Das's book brings to life the timeless wisdom of Buddhism in traditional teaching stories and heartfelt everyday examples.

That's what Paul Mariani found out when he went on retreat with the Exercises of St. Ignatius, as he explains in <i>Thirty Days</i>. Mariani, a poet and literary critic, spent the month of January one year at a retreat center on the rocky Atlantic coast near Gloucester, Massachusetts. During that time he confronted his past experiences as a father, husband, teacher, and Christian and arrived at some surprising conclusions about his place in God's world. <i>Thirty Days</i>--a work of probing self-examination, including much reflection on the lives of St. Ignatius and Jesus--is the journal that he kept during that period. Readers of this fine, honest, intelligent book will be quietly assured by something Mariani himself learned from Ignatius's Exercises. "How consoling to know that, no matter how small we may think we are against the backdrop of eternity, we do count in the cosmic scheme of things." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Paul Mariani, an award-winning poet, biographer of William Carlos Williams and Robert Lowell, and critic, holds a Chair in English at Boston College.

He wants a smaller America, a poorer America, an America unable to exert its will, an America happy to be one power among many, an America in decline so that other nations might rise all in the name of global fairness. To Obama, the hated one percent&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t just wealthy Americas; it is America itself. In Obama&#x2019;s view, America needs to be taken down a notch.<br> <br>That is the startling conclusion of bestselling author Dinesh D&#x2019;Souza in <i>Obama&#x2019;s America</i>. Building on his previous <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Roots of Obama&#x2019;s Rage</i> which Newt Gingrich called Stunning the most profound insight I have read in the last six years&#x201d; D&#x2019;Souza shows how Obama&#x2019;s goal to downsize America is in plain sight but ignored by everyone.<br> <br>D&#x2019;Souza lays out what Obama plans to do in a second administration a makeover of America so drastic that the shining city on a hill&#x201d; will become a shantytown in a rather dangerous global village. Arresting in its presentation and sobering in its conclusions, <i>Obama&#x2019;s America</i> is essential reading for those who want to change America&#x2019;s course before it&#x2019;s too late.</p><p><b>FROM <i>OBAMA'S AMERICA</i></b><br><p><br>Obama is not merely the presiding instrument of American decline, he is the architect of American decline. He wants America to be downsized. He wants Americans to consume less, and he would like to see our standard of living decline relative to that of other nations. He seeks a diminished footprint for America in the world. He detests America's traditional allies, like Britain and Israel, and seeks to weaken them; he is not very worried about radical Muslims acquiring a nuclear bomb or coming to power in countries like Tunisia and Egypt. He is quite willing to saddle future dollars toward this end and if he had been permitted, he would have spent trillions more. He has shown no inclination, and has no desire, to protect America's position as number one in the world; he would be content to see America as number 18, or number 67, just another country seated at the great dining table of nations. The strength of my thesis is that it is completely congruent with who Obama is and what he does. We don't have to assume that he is always getting results opposite to what he intends; we simply have to see that he intends the results he is getting. He emphasized in his inauguration speech his goal of "remaking America"&#x2014;and he is doing it, recognizing that in order to remake America he must first unmake America. The only question is whether Americans approve of their country being diminished and downsized, and whether they want to give Obama another four years to finish the job.<br></p>Dinesh D'Souza is the president of The King's College in New York City and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Roots of Obama's Rage</i>.

They reached East Timor on June 5. Once there, they posed as survivors of a shipwreck, until they were eventually discovered and ordered back to England. <i>The Memorandoms of James Martin </i>is the only known chronicle written by members of that first group of prisoners, and this convict narrative is also the only firsthand account of the best-known Australian convict escape. This document, confirmed in its details by careful scholarly analysis, clarifies one of the most important origin stories of Australian history.</p><p><b>Tim Causer</b> is a senior research associate at the Bentham Project in UCL&#x2019;s faculty of laws.Causer&#x2019;s impressive introduction contextualises the Bryants&#x2019; escape&#x2014;though extraordinary in some respects&#x2014;within a broader timeline of convict resistance to colonial authorities. He builds on existing historiography, to show that absconding into the bush or escaping in a boat was a logical and not uncommon form of resistance in early New South Wales . . . Causer&#x2019;s account is refreshingly transparent about exactly what evidence is available and what can be reasonably assumed, which serves as an important counterbalance to much 'unevidenced embroidering and embellishment of the historical record' in the past about the escape. This technique is also used to explain&#x2014;rather than just call out&#x2014;the many inaccuracies that have arisen about the Byrant party in the historical record. Causer&#x2019;s meticulous tracing of the convict absconders through the archives, from their conviction to their release from Newgate, is a great strength of this edition. . . .

But when Jeffrey is diagnosed with leukemia, Steven's world is turned upside down. He is forced to deal with his brother's illness and his parents' attempts to keep the family in one piece.

Not only did he make this story about a 13-year-old boy, whose little brother contracts leukemia, real and raw and heart-rending, he made it hysterically funny as well. Steven Alper, who is untalented in sports but terrific on the drums, is giving his pesky five-year-old brother Jeffrey oatmeal when Jeffrey, who has been complaining recently that his "parts hurt," falls off a stool and gets a nosebleed that just won't quit. That night Steven finds out that Jeffrey has leukemia. Although the plot&#x2014;Steven's stressed-out family has no energy for him and he becomes a source of strength for his brother while simultaneously falling apart himself&#x2014;is conventional, the subsidiary characters at home, school and the hospital have a flesh-and-blood reality and the situations ring true. Moreover, the reader falls in love with the brothers, laughing and crying by turns and rooting for both of them until it almost hurts. (Fiction. 12+)<br><br>Booklist Starred Review 9/15/05<br>\\\\\\\\*STAR* Sonnenblick, Jordan. Drums, Girls &amp; Dangerous Pie. Sept. 2005. Scholastic, $16 (0-439-75519-0).<br> Gr. 5&#x2013;8. Steven Alper is a typical eighth-grader&#x2013;&#x2013;smarter than some, certainly a better drummer than most, but with the usual girl problems and family trials. Then, on October 7, his five-year-old brother Jeffery falls, has a nosebleed that doesn't stop, and is diagnosed with leukemia. All hell breaks loose. Mrs. Alper's days and nights revolve around getting Jeffrey to his chemotherapy treatments, and Mr. Alper retreats into a shell, coming out only occasionally to weep over the mounting medical bills. Steven becomes the forgotten son, who throws himself into drumming, even as he quits doing his homework and tries to keep his friends from finding out about Jeffrey's illness. A story that could have morphed into melodrama is saved by reality, rawness, and the wit Sonnenblick infuses to Steven's first-person voice. The recriminations, cares, and nightmares that come with a cancer diagnosis are all here, underscored by vomiting, white blood cell counts, and chemotherapy ports. Yet, this is also about regrouping, solidarity, love, and hope. Most important for a middle-grade audience, Sonneblick shows that even in the midst of tragedy, life goes on, love can flower, and that the one thing you can always change is yourself. &#x2013;&#x2013;Ilene Cooper<br><br>Kliatt 9/1/05<br>SONNENBLICK, Jordan. Drums, girls &amp; dangerous pie. Scholastic. 273p. Steven is in the 8th grade; he's a talented drummer who is part of an all-city jazz band, one of the youngest members. He's got a crush on a beautiful girl, a math whiz; but another girl seems more interested in him. That's the drums and girls part of the title. The "dangerous pie" is more difficult to explain, but it is something outrageous Steven's little brother Jeffrey says. Jeffrey is a precocious kindergarten student, who drives Steven nuts, but Steven doesn't realize at the beginning of the story just how important Jeffrey is in his life. Amidst the quite funny wisecracks and comments (Steven is considered a good musician with a wicked sense of humor) comes tragedy when Jeffrey is diagnosed with leukemia. Everything changes: to manage the cancer therapy, the mother has to quit her teaching job and thus the family income is cut in half; the father retreats into a non-communicative shell of grief; Steven is troubled and angry; little Jeffrey endures painful and nauseating treatments. Months later, everyone in the family is exhausted but learning to communicate, to pull together better. The school psychologist offers this wisdom to Steven: "Instead of agonizing about the things you can't change, why don't you try working on the things you can change?" Sonnenblick describes family life with great skill, and the frequently humorous anecdotes are entertaining, even when the basic story is grim. He manages to balance between horror and humor. This is the author's first novel, and he brings to it his knowledge of middle school students (he's been a middle school English teacher) and his understanding of how families work (he's married and the father of two children). Readers will love each and every character. Claire Rosser, KLIATT<br>BCCB November<br>Steven is attempting to survive the ordinarily painful life of an eighth-grader when his family gets hit with something out of the ordinary: his younger brother, five-year-old Jeffrey, is diagnosed with leukemia. Suddenly the Alper household is focused on Jeffrey's chemotherapy, Jeffrey's white-cell count, Jeffrey's temperature; meanwhile Steven's father, overwhelmed by the situation and the bills, checks out from the family, and Steven's school performance dwindles to nothing. Steven's narration reflects his credible seesaw between self-interest and protective panic: he's furious that no one in his family will be able to see him perform his great solo in concert, but he's devastated at the torment his annoying yet beloved baby brother must undergo. Less deft, however, is the plotting, which is inclined toward predictability (Steven realizes that his female friend is a more suitable girlfriend than the hot classmate he's been panting after); Jeffrey is often contrivedly rather convincingly drawn, and there's a jarring contrast between Stephen's heavily glib voice and the interpolated medical information he often conveys. The humor and earnestness of Steven's narration may nonetheless reassure young preteens who feel similarly helpless in the face of life's big and small challenges,<br><br>Horn Book<br>Jordan Sonnenblick Drums, Girls &amp; Dangerous Pie<br>273 pp. Scholastic 9/05 ISBN 0-439-75519-0 $16.99<br>(Middle School)<br>Sonnenblick's debut novel is a strikingly honest portrayal of a little boy's struggle with cancer as witnessed by his older brother. Eighth-grader Steven is mainly preoccupied with the drums he loves, the girls who ignore his existence, and the constant annoyance of five-year-old Jeffrey's presence (epitomized by the "dangerous pie" incident, in which Steven's prized drumsticks are used to stir a "zesty blend of coffee grounds, raw eggs and their smashed shells, Coke, uncooked bacon,<br>and three Matchbox racing cars"). Then Jeffrey is diagnosed with leukemia, and life departs from the expected. The novel wisely avoids<br>a resolution of Jeffrey's illness, focusing instead on the family's painful process of adjustment. A few unfortunate subplots&#x2013;the predictable romantic triangle, the brief introduction and subsequent death of young leukemia patient Samantha&#x2013;are more formula than innovation, and<br>the epilogue's sudden about-face toward optimism cheapens the anguish of previous chapters. Nevertheless, Sonnenblick's central characters resonate with sincerity as they navigate a precarious balancing act between daily life and hospital drama with heart and humor. Jeffrey is mischievous and endearing, but it is Steven, a convincing maelstrom of brotherly love, fear, and resentment, who will break readers' hearts. CLAIRE E. GROSS<br><br>PW Sonnenblick's insightful debut novel charts the way a talented 13-year-old drummer's life changes when his five-year-old brother, Jeffrey, is diagnosed with leukemia. Steven, whose story unfolds through his journals for English class, was the first drummer ever admitted into the All-City High School Band in the seventh grade, and this year, as an eighth grader, his future looks even brighter. After Jeffrey is diagnosed with cancer, his mother must spend more time taking Jeffrey to treatment and the family's finances begin to suffer; Steven takes refuge in the basement, practicing the drums for hours. The author perceptively records the struggle within Steven to lash out against his parents for feeling neglected and to feel compassion for his brother, as well as the normal adolescent concerns, including overlooking childhood friend Annette ("It's like she's figured out how to play [piano] like Beethoven and Thelonious Monk but hasn't quite mastered the art of being a girl yet"), who clearly has a crush on him, in favor of unattainable girl-next-door Renee. The journal structure is not always entirely believable, but Steven's thoughts and feelings are (after his mother returns from one of Jeffrey's treatments, Steven has an epiphany: "I realized without any shadow of a doubt that she would have done the same for me"). Readers may well feel inspired by the teen's gradual growth over the course of the novel, and drummers especially will enjoy this insider's view. Ages 12-up. (Oct.)<br></p><h2>To the Rescue! Garrett Morgan Underground: Great Ideas Series (Great Idea Series)</h2><p><p>The son of freed slaves, Garrett Morgan was determined to have a better life than laboring in the Kentucky fields with his parents and ten siblings. He began by sweeping floors in a clothing factory in Cleveland, Ohio, where he decided to invent a stronger belt for sewing machines. When he was promoted to sewing-machine repairman, Garrett was on his way. In 1911, 146 workers died in the shocking Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City, so Garrett decided to invent a safety hood for firefighters. Little did he know that most people wouldn't be interested in buying his safety hood when they discovered its inventor was black. But an explosion that trapped workers in a tunnel under Lake Erie soon changed all that. Garrett's hoods were rushed to the scene and used to rescue as many men as possible. Developed further, Garrett's invention came to save thousands of soldiers from chlorine gas in the trenches of World War I.</p></p><p><b>Monica Kulling</b> is a poet who has published over forty books for children, including picture books, adaptations of classic novels, and biographies.

Judis, one of our most insightful political commentators, most rational and careful thinkers, and most engaged witnesses in Washington, has taken on a challenge that even the most concerned American citizens shrink from: forecasting the American political climate at the turn of the century. <b>The Paradox of American Democracy</b> is a penetrating examination of our democracy that illuminates the forces and institutions that once enlivened it and now threaten to undermine it. It is the well-reasoned discussion we need in this era of unrestrained expert opinions and ideologically biased testimony.<br><br>The disenchantment with our political system can be seen in decreasing voter turnout, political parties co-opted by consultants and large contributors, the corrupting influence of "soft money," and concern for national welfare subverted by lobbying organizations and special-interest groups. Judis revisits particular moments -- the Progressive Era, the New Deal, the 1960s -- to discover what makes democracy the most efficacious and, consequently, most inefficacious. What has worked in the past is a balancing act between groups of elites --- trade commissions, labor relations boards, policy groups -- whose mandates are to act in the national interest and whose actions are governed by a disinterested pursuit of the common good. Judis explains how the displacment of such elites by a new lobbying community in Whashington has given rise to the cynicism that corrodes the current political system.<br><br><b>The Paradox of American Democracy</b> goes straight to the heart of every political debate in this country.</p><p>As the United States faces what many see as another lackluster election in November 2000, John B. Judis's <i>The Paradox of American Democracy</i> addresses the decline of public participation in national politics over the course of the 20th century. He persuasively attributes the blame to the deteriorated relationship between unions and grassroots activists and the elite policy foundations that often championed their causes, a relationship eroded by self-interested businessmen and populist demagoguery. American political life, Judis writes, was never strictly a contest between popular and wealthy special-interest groups. Public policy organizations such as the Ford Foundation and the Brookings Institution, for example, have pushed for, or refereed, legislation for social, economic, and political reform that benefited labor, civil rights, and environmental activists. Since the 1970s, though, think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute have pursued their own economic interests by forging links with reactionary populist groups like the Moral Majority, silencing progressive voices less able to present their interests amidst the onslaught of corporate propaganda. Public policy, Judis feels, is now formed primarily by lobbyists rather than those concerned about the broader public welfare.<p> <i>Paradox</i> presents a detailed portrait of how organized political blocs, independent public policy foundations, and the federal government have interacted over the last 100 years, and how the relationship has been eroded by corporate priorities. While his facts are correct, Judis's fondness for the hegemonic social order of FDR's New Deal and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society might raise objections from sympathetic readers who feel that vital leftist energy was co-opted by post-Fordism, not enabled by it. The link between activists' declining access to power and the dwindling electoral turnout could also be made more explicit. Judis nevertheless provides a brisk and informative history of the structure of American civic life. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>"John Judis is our finest reporter and analyst of Washington's inner workings. His new book brilliantly relates the secret history of the Clinton era -- its origins, its frustrations, and its disloyal opponents. It is a chilling tale that others have been either too trusting or too timid to tell straight." <br>-- Sean Wilentz, Dayton-Stockton Professor of History, Princeton University<br><p>"This is a compelling analysis of our irresponsible elite -- and an astute history of times when 'the public interest' had real meaning. John Judis is one of America's best political journalists, and his book is essential to understanding our current political mandates."<br>-- Michael Kazin, author of <b>The Populist Persuasion: An American History</b><br></p><p>"With the insight that has made him one of our wisest political observers, John Judis makes a trenchant analysis of what has gone wrong with American democracy -- and how it can be corrected."<br>-- Ronald Steel, author of <b>In Love with Night: The American Romance with Robert Kennedy</b></p></p><h2>Emily Carr: On the Edge of Nowhere</h2><p>Despite the isolating factors of geography, poor finances and failing health, Emily Carr was connected to the major cultural figures and movements of her time.

In World War II he fought as an artillery officer, attaining the rank of captain. In 1945, however, after making derogatory remarks about Stalin in a letter, he was arrested and summarily sentenced to eight years in forced labour camps, followed by internal exile. In 1957 he formally rehabilitated, and settled down to teaching and writing. The publication of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in Novy Mir in 1962 was followed by publication, in the West, of his novels Cancer Ward and The First Circle. In 1970 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and in 1974 his citizenship was revoked and he was expelled from the Soviet Union. He settled in Vermont and worked on his great historical cycle The Red Wheel. In 1990, with the fall of Soviet Communism, his citizenship was restored and four years later he returned to settle in Russia.</p><h2>Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion : Revised and Enlarged</h2><p>This text on gas turbine technology has been a best-seller since it was first published in 1984.

It's 1952, and Buddy Palumbo, just 19, may not be the most gifted mechanic to hang around Old Man Finzio's Sinclair gas station, but he can't stay away. Turning down his father's offer of a union job in a chemical factory, Buddy is lured into the grease-pit by glimpses of Finzio's curvaceous daughter Julie and by the macho auto-repair skills of ex-Marine Butch Bohunk. When Bohunk, in a drunken rage over the shrewish Mean Marlene, drives his battered Ford into a highway support somewhere outside Passaic, Palumbo becomes Finzio's head mechanic and has to maintain the creamy white Jaguar XK120 roadster of tough-talking scrap dealer Big Ed Baumstein. A problem with the Jag's touchy carburetor sends Palumbo to a Manhattan dealership, where he learns the sleazy tricks of the import luxury car trade from pompous owner Colin St. John and shifty sidekick Barry Spline. From there it's a short hop to the world of open-road sport-car racing (on make-shift courses laid out on rural roads) in Bridgehampton. Big Ed is snubbed by upper-class blue bloods, while Palumbo is smitten with the skin-deep charms of Sally Enderle, girlfriend of wealthy cad Creighton Pendleton. Sports journalist Levy, a former semi-pro race-car driver, matches the street-smart savvy and honest labors of Palumbo and Big Ed against a predictable pack of rich snobs, with mostly predictable results, varying the formula only at the end, when an unforseen mishap at Watkins Glen ends open-road racing forever. Big Ed and Palumbo return to the sizzling asphalt of Passaic, where Palumbo wonders whether he'll ever race again. Funny high-octane fuel for fans of the comic nostalgia tales of humorist Jean Shepherd; crowded equally with typecast characters and vivid racing scenes. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Every time he gets close, it disappears again! Bird was using it as a nest, but it was too heavy; Bear used it in his drum kit, but it was too tinny; the Squirrels built sandcastles with it...and now it looks as if they're sailing away in it.

The illustration career won and she has now illustrated around 100 books. When she met Paul Linnet she found another twit with a silly sense of humour so they fell in love and started writing and illustrating together and came up with bestsellers such as Barry the Fish with Fingers, Norman the Slug with the Silly Shell, Nobot the Robot with No Bottom, Supertato and most recently I Need a Wee. It seems that others enjoy their frankly ridiculous stories and they have won prizes and all sorts. Some nice people even had the great idea to make the book Wanda and the Alien by Sue into a world-wide TV phenomenon! Sue and Paul live in an untidy and half decorated house in the seaside town of Brighton. They have a daughter called Wanda who is perfect in every way possible. Sue is pretty good at swimming and Paul likes to ride around on an old motorbike that he&#39;s fussed about with.Silly, funny, and very enjoyable to read!

Featuring more than 500 full-color photographs and hundreds more step-by-step sketches of grooming techniques, this book provides specifics for 170 dog breeds. </p><p> The first section of the book covers caring for and grooming a pet dog: how to keep its coat healthy; tips for routine care; how to bathe a dog; and how to choose a groomer. The second section covers grooming as a profession, including starting a grooming business; choosing and buying equipment; how to detect coat and skin disorders; and tips on handling problems that commonly arise. </p><p> The third section covers specific grooming information for the 170 individual breeds. Each chapter is dedicated to a type of coat and then further organized into step-by-step instructions for grooming each breed from start to finish. Insider tips on preparing a dog for show are also included. </p><p> <b>Ultimate Dog Grooming</b> is the ideal reference for learning how to clip, strip and blow-dry a dog. Pet owners as well as professional groomers, handlers, trainers and dog-daycare specialists will treasure this definitive reference book. </p></p><p><p> <b>Eileen Geeson</b> is the author of <i>The Complete Standard Poodle</i> and a contributor to the grooming section of <i>Ultimate Puppy</i>. A championship show judge, she has a world record of Standard Poodle entries and 30 years dog grooming experience. </p><p> <b>Barbara Vetter</b> owned a grooming shop for 15 years. </p><p> <b>Lia Whitmore</b> has a Masters Certificate with the National Dog Groomers' Association of America. </p><p><b> Chapter 1: COAT TYPES </b></p><p> Many people think grooming is all about clipping Poodles, but it is much more than that. Grooming is the act of keeping the skin and coat in a healthy, clean, balanced state. It also involves the maintenance of teeth, ears and nails. </p><p> Grooming is an integral part of dog care. Not only does it keep the animal clean and looking good, but it is also a social act that strengthens the relationship between handler and dog. </p><p> How you groom a dog depends on the breed, coat type and the owner's personal preferences. Anyone can put a dog on a table and brush its coat up and down for a few moments, but with a little thought and hard work, both dog and owner can enjoy the experience and, who knows, you may be a future Groomer of the Year as a result! </p><p><b> Buying a Dog: Coat Considerations </b></p><p> Among the many breeds of dog, there is a tremendous difference in the types of coat. Certainly, one should take this into serious consideration before taking on a breed of dog.</p><ul> <li>Can you cope with the hair?</li> <li>Will the dog require professional grooming help? (See Chapter Four.)</li> <li>Can you afford the outlay of regular trips to the grooming parlor?</li> <li>Are you, or any of your family, asthmatic or allergic to shedding dog hair or dandruff or both?</li> <li>Could you cope with all those long curls that get covered with mud during a wet walk?</li> </ul><p></p><p> These are just a few questions that need to be considered before deciding on the right breed for your family. It is wise to speak to owners of your shortlisted breeds before making your final choice. </p><p> Your national kennel club will be able to put you in contact with breed clubs of those types of dogs you might be interested in. The club representatives can tell you how demanding the coat care is for their particular breed so you will know exactly what you will be taking on. </p><p> It is a good idea to consult a groomer to inquire about the cost of grooming sessions before making a final decision on which breed is right for your family. Additionally, groomers, who have worked with dogs of many breeds for many years, often have valuable knowledge to impart about the characteristics of different breeds. </p><p> For full information on grooming different coat types and the equipment needed, see Part Three. </p><p><b> Puppy Coats </b></p><p> Puppies of all breeds have a softer coat than they will have on gaining maturity, and it is easy to underestimate the grooming that is required as the dog matures. </p><p> Poodles, for instance, have a soft, fluffy wool coat that is easy to keep until they are about 7 months of age, when the coat will thicken. Unless it is properly groomed, the coat will mat or felt against the skin, especially if the coat gets wet and is left to its own devices to dry. </p><p><b> Basic Coat Types </b></p><p> There are many different types of coats. Part Three of this book is organized into the following categories:</p><ul> <li>The short coat (example: the Whippet)</li> <li>The long coat (example: the Yorkshire Terrier)</li> <li>The corded/curly coat (example: The Curly-Coated Retriever)</li> <li>The medium/silky coat (example: the Irish Setter)</li> <li>The thick coat (example: the Finnish Lapphund)</li> <li>The stripped coat (example: the Airedale Terrier)</li> <li>The trimmed/clipped coat (example: the Bichon Frise)</li> </ul><p></p></p><h2>The Very First Shoe Book</h2><p>The adventures of Purple Martin Shoemaker, Editor-in-Chief of &#34;The Treetop Tattler Tribune,&#34; and his many friends.</p><p></p><h2>Susan Glaspell&#39;s Trifle</h2><p>A famous one-play act, Trifle is a story of a mysterious murder, loosely based on the real-life case of John Hossack. The act was first played by Provincetown Players on August 8, 1916. In the original performance Glaspell played the role of Mrs. Hale. An early example of feminist drama, the two female leads show sympathy to the victim&#39;s wife, Minnie. In contrast, the men was shown to be cold and indifferent.

But she's made some powerful enemies who will stop at nothing-not even murder.</b><br>The world is watching as massive crowds gather in Rome, waiting for news of a new pope, one who promises to be unlike any other in history. It's a turning point that may change the Church forever. Some followers are ecstatic that the movement reinvigorating the Church is about to reach the Vatican, but the leading candidate has made a legion of powerful enemies who aren't afraid to kill for their cause. <br>From a difficult childhood with drug addled parents, to a career as a doctor on the front lines in Sudan, to a series of trials that test her faith at every turn, Brigid Fitzgerald's convictions and callings have made her the target of all those who fear that the Church has lost its way-dangerous adversaries who abhor challenges to tradition. Locked in a deadly, high-stakes battle with forces determined to undermine everything she believes in, Brigid must convert her enemies to her cause before she loses her faith . . . and her life. <br>From a civil war in Sudan to the drug dens and law firms of Boston, <i>Woman of God</i> spans the globe with a thrilling tale of perseverance, love, trust and what it means to live in a fallen world.</p><p>James Patterson holds the Guinness World Record for the most #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

She lost everything-her badge, her career, her freedom-and spent two years in prison. Now she's back on the outside and focused on one mission: to be a cop once more. Her only shot to be a true blue again is to solve a major case on her own, and prove she has the right to wear the uniform. But even with her police chief sister on her side, she has to work in the shadows: A vindictive U.S. attorney is looking for any reason to send Mace back behind bars. Then Roy Kingman enters her life.<br><br>Roy is a young lawyer who aided the poor until he took a high-paying job at a law firm in Washington. Mace and Roy meet after he discovers the dead body of a female partner at the firm. As they investigate the death, they start uncovering surprising secrets from both the private and public world of the nation's capital. <br><br>Soon, what began as a fairly routine homicide takes a terrifying and unexpected turn-into something complex, diabolical, and possibly lethal.</p><p>David Baldacci lives with his family in Virginia. He and his wife have founded the Wish You Well Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting literacy efforts across America. He invites you to visit him at www.david-baldacci.com and his foundation at www.wishyouwellfoundation.org, and to look into its program to spread books across America at www.FeedingBodyandMind.com.This promising first in a new series from bestseller Baldacci (<i>First Family</i>) introduces Beth Perry, chief of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police, and Beth's younger sister, Mace Perry, a former police officer dubbed the Patty Hearst of the twenty-first century after she was seized by bandits, drugged and taken along on a series of armed robberies around Washington. Mace, who's just getting out of prison after serving a two-year sentence, is willing to risk everything to clear her name and reclaim her life as a cop by cracking a big case on her own. The rape-murder of a powerful lawyer as well as the killing of a prominent U.S. attorney provide Mace an opportunity to vindicate herself. While Baldacci draws his characters in bright primary colors, and some of the action reaches comic book proportions, he delivers his usual intricate plotting and sets the stage nicely for highly competent Beth and impulsive, streetwise Mace to take on more bad guys. <i>(Oct. 27)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Visit Jana on her website, www.janadeleon.com.Psychiatrist Alexandria Bastin clutched the cell phone at her cousin's words. "Repeat that." She couldn't possibly have heard her correctly.<p>"The witch took her! She took my baby!" Sarah's wailing pierced Alex's ear, even through the phone.</p><p>"Calm down, Sarah," Alex said and waved off a nurse who had paused during her rotation to see if Alex needed help. "Take a deep breath and tell me everything." She hurried down the hall and into her office to escape the normal noises of the busy hospital. "How long has Erika been missing?"</p><p>"Since this afternoon. She went down the street to play with her friend." The hysterical tone in Sarah's voice continued to rise with each sentence. "She was supposed to be home at three, but she never came. I waited and waited and she never came."</p><p>"What did the friend's mother say?"</p><p>"That Erika left in time to get home. She's gone, Alex, and no one will believe me. My baby! What happened to my baby?" Sarah began sobbing. "I called and called but you never answered."</p><p>Alex grabbed her purse from her desk drawer and locked her office. "I'm on my way. Sarah, can you hear me?"</p><p>The sound of frantic sobbing was all Alex heard as she rushed into the elevator. As soon as the elevator door closed, the call dropped. Alex looked at her display and cursed when she saw the list of missed calls from her cousin. She'd been tied up all afternoon giving a videotaped statement for a commitment hearing and had turned off her phone, but now she wished she hadn't.</p><p>Mentally, she willed the elevator to move faster and as soon as the door opened to the parking garage, she ran to her car, pressing in Sarah's number as she ran. The busy signal had her cursing again.</p><p>She jumped into her car and tore out of the parking lot toward the highway. Even with a fast car and a lead foot, it would take her at least an hour to get to Sarah's house. She pressed redial, and the busy signal sounded once again. Glancing in her rearview mirror, she merged onto the highway and immediately moved to the fast lane.</p><p>Out of options, she dialed 9-1-1.</p><p>"This is Dr. Alexandria Bastin. I'm a resident psychiatrist at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans. I have reason to believe that a patient is suffering from a serious mental episode and I cannot get her to answer the phone. I'm on my way, but I need someone to check on Sarah Rhonaldo at 152 Cypress Lane in Vodoun."</p><p>She pressed her foot down harder on the accelerator and prayed that Sarah hadn't done something foolish. Her cousin had separated from Erika's father three months before, and it hadn't been pleasant&#x2014;especially not for Sarah's husband, her best friend, or the bed she'd caught them having sex in, as it had met a tragic end, hatchet style.</p><p>Alex had managed, with the help of a great attorney, to get the charges reduced to destruction of private property, but Sarah's Paul Bunyan routine hadn't scored her any points with the local sheriff. Given that their families had been warring since the dawn of time, the bed-hatchet escapade cemented Sheriff Conroy's belief that Sarah was worthless trash.</p><p>She could only hope Sarah hadn't done anything to jeopardize her health...or her parole. Alex didn't even want to think about what might have happened to Erika until she got face-to-face with Sarah and heard the entire story.</p><p>A truck displaying the sheriff's logo on the side was in front of Sarah's house when Alex pulled up just before seven p.m. <i>This can't be good.</i> She pulled in behind the truck and parked. She'd been hoping for an ambulance, but there was no sign of a paramedic anywhere. Which meant whatever had happened to Sarah, her health was fine, but given that the sheriff was still there, her freedom might be in question.</p><p>She grabbed her purse and hurried into the house without bothering to knock. "Sarah," she called, scanning the rooms as she rushed down the hall.</p><p>"Back here," Sarah answered, her voice weak.</p><p>Alex ran the rest of the way down the hall and into the kitchen and ran straight into the last person in the world she expected or wanted to see.</p><p>His shoulders were wider, his upper body harder and leaner than she'd ever seen him. And she'd seen every inch. "Holt," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "I didn't know you were back."</p><p>Ten years ago, he'd run away to war&#x2014;the one place he could be certain his past couldn't follow him.</p><p>His hands were still on her shoulders, and he stood so close she could feel the heat coming off his body. The smell of his aftershave tickled her nose, and instantly she remembered the last time his hands had been on her body. The last time she'd been completely absorbed with Holt&#x2014;mind, body and soul.</p><p>"Been back for a month now," he said, and looked down at her with those sexy green eyes that had been the cause of many a weak moment on her part.</p><p><i>But no more.</i></p><p>She stepped back so that he was forced to drop his hands, and that was when she noticed the badge on his belt. "You're working for your uncle?"</p><p>"I'm just filling in until I figure out what I want to do next and until his broken leg heals."</p><p>"Is Sarah okay?"</p><p>Holt moved to the side and motioned her into the breakfast nook where Sarah sat, staring out the back window. "You tell me."</p><p>Alex walked over to the table and slid onto the chair next to Sarah. Her cousin took one look at her, flung her arms around her neck and began sobbing. "They don't believe me. My baby's gone and they don't believe me." The volume of her voice increased with every word until she was shouting.</p><p>Alex untangled Sarah's arms from her neck and studied her cousin. Her skin was pale, but normal, given the situation. Her eyes were red from crying, but Alex didn't see any disconnect from reality in them.</p><p>"Who doesn't believe you?"</p><p>Sarah pointed to Holt. "The sheriff's department. They think I'm crazy."</p><p>A flash of anger washed over Alex like a tidal wave and she turned to face Holt. "A six-year-old is missing from her own neighborhood in broad daylight. Exactly what does it take for the sheriff's department to become concerned?"</p><p>"My uncle said&#x2014;"</p><p>"Your uncle wouldn't have a nice thing to say about Sarah even if it meant avoiding eternal damnation." Alex turned her attention back to Sarah. "I need you to take a deep breath and tell me what happened."</p><p>Sarah nodded and took a deep breath, blowing it slowly out. "Right after lunch, Erika went to her friend's house up the street to play. I stood outside and watched her until she went inside their house. She was supposed to be home by three."</p><p>"But she didn't come home?"</p><p>"No. At three-fifteen, I called her friend's mother to remind Erika to leave, but the mother said Erika had left at five 'til, just like she was supposed to."</p><p>"Did the friend's mother watch her walk home?"</p><p>"No. Erika walked with her friend all the way to the house and then her friend crossed the street to go to her music lesson."</p><p>"Did her friend see Erika go in the house?"</p><p>Sarah shook her head. "She said when she was closing the door, she saw Erika checking the mail. But when I came outside to look for her, the mail was lying in the street." Sarah began to cry again. "They think Bobby took her. He's a lying, worthless, cheating waste-of-a-husband, but he's a good father. Bobby would never take Erika away from me."</p><p>Alex blew out a breath, trying to make sense of everything Sarah had said. Her cousin's story didn't fill in all the gaps and she had a feeling those gaps were important. Unfortunately, the one person who could give her the answers she needed was the last person she wanted to talk to.</p><p>She opened her purse and took out a prescription for antianxiety medication that she'd filled for Sarah the day before. Ever since Sarah's split from Bobby, she'd had trouble sleeping and concentrating. The meds took the edge off and allowed her to act normal even though she didn't feel normal. "I want you to take this," she said, and placed a pill in Sarah's hand. "I need to know everything you can think of. In order to be helpful, you need to be refreshed and calm. While the medicine is doing its job, I want you to take a hot shower."</p><p>Sarah opened her mouth to protest, but Alex held up a hand to stop her. "I'm saying this as your doctor. No arguments."</p><p>Sarah looked at Alex, her expression wavering between wanting to comply and wanting to argue, then she glanced over at Holt and sighed. "Fine."</p><p>Alex rose from the table and pushed a glass of water closer to Sarah. Sarah placed the pill in her mouth and took a big drink, her hand shaking a bit as she lowered the glass back to the table. Her cousin rose from the table and hugged Alex.</p><p>"I feel better already because you're here," Sarah said. "You're the smartest person I know. You'll find Erika." Sarah broke off the hug and trudged down the hall toward her bedroom.</p><p>Alex stared after her, trying to keep her own heart from breaking over the situation. She and Sarah had been born only a month apart and were more like sisters than cousins. She and Erika were the only family Alex had left since her own parents had died in a car wreck twelve years before. The day Erika was born, Alex had been almost as proud as Sarah, and to think of that little girl, taken from her home, was beyond upsetting. But one of them had to remain calm and collected, and that role almost always fell to Alex.</p><p>She looked over at Holt, who was leaning against the kitchen counter. "I need you to tell me exactly what is going on. No speculation or your uncle's gossip. Cold, hard facts are all I'm interested in."</p><p>Holt smiled. <i>&amp;#...</i></p></p><h2>Surrogacy: A Human Rights Violation (Spinifex Shorts)</h2><p>Pared down to cold hard facts, surrogacy is the commissioning/buying/ renting of a woman into whose womb an embryo is inserted and who thus becomes a &#x2018;breeder&#x2019; for a third party.&nbsp;Surrogacy is heavily promoted by the stagnating IVF industry which seeks new markets for women over 40, and gay men who believe they have a &#x2018;right&#x2019; to their own children and &#x2018;family foundation&#x2019;. Pro-surrogacy groups in rich countries such as Australia and Western Europe lobby for the shift to commercial surrogacy. Their capitalist neo-liberal argument is that a well-regulated fertility industry would avoid the exploitative practices of poor countries.&nbsp;Central to the project of cross-border surrogacy is the ideology that legalised commercial surrogacy is a legitimate means to provide infertile couples and gay men with children who share all or part of their genes. Women, without whose bodies this project is not possible are reduced to incubators, to ovens, to suitcases. And the &#x2018;product child&#x2019; is a tradable commodity who has never consented to being a &#x2018;take away baby&#x2019;: removed from their birth mother and given to strangers aka &#x2018;intended parents&#x2019;. Still, those in favour of this practice of reproductive slavery speak of &#x2018;Fair Trade Surrogacy&#x2019; and &#x2018;responsible surrogacy&#x2019;.&nbsp;In <i>Surrogacy: A Human Rights Violation</i> Renate Klein details her objections to surrogacy by examining the short- and long-term harms done to the so-called surrogate mothers, egg providers and the female partner in a heterosexual commissioning couple. Klein also looks at the rights of children and compares surrogacy to (forced) adoption practices. She concludes that surrogacy, whether so-called altruistic or commercial can never be ethical and outlines forms of resistance to Stop Surrogacy Now. www.stopsurrogacynow.com&nbsp;It is the global advertising campaigns that groom infertile couples and gay men that have led to the establishment of multibillion cross-border industries: money made literally from women&#x2019;s flesh.</p><p><b>Dr Renate Klein</b> is a long-term women's health researcher and has written extensively on reproductive technologies and feminist theory over the last thirty years.

No, thank you.

Now a prickly recluse, he hides away in the old hotel slowly dying of cancer, which he refuses to treat. If she can just convince him to sign the infamous guestbook of Percy Coates, Dorothy Parker might be able to persuade the jaded writer to spurn the white light with her.&nbsp;Ted, however, might be the only person living or dead who&#x2019;s more stubborn than Parker, and he rejects her proposal outright. &nbsp;<br><br>When a young, ambitious TV producer, Norah Wolfe, enters the hotel in search of Ted Shriver, Parker sees another opportunity to get what she wants.

One minute she was aware of a terrible pain radiating from the middle of her chest, and the next she was floating in a warm, brothy bath, where everything around her hovered at the same temperature as her body. She couldn&#x2019;t tell where she began and the world left off.</p><p>Then she saw it&#x2014;the white light. For a moment, she felt the pull, but caught herself in time. No thank you. Eternal happiness was simply not what she was cut out for. She would stay right here, wherever that was, and let darkness overtake her.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Parker?&#x201d;</p><p>As if awaking from a dream, she opened her eyes to discover she was in the dimly lit tavern of the Algonquin Hotel, alone except for a familiar silhouette at the bar . . . and that damned white light hovering overhead. </p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Benchley?&#x201d; she said, though she would have known that full-cheeked profile anywhere. As usual, his hair was well oiled and his<br>mustache neatly trimmed.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you.&#x201d;</p><p>Dear, dear Mr. Benchley. She took a seat next to him, where a fresh gin and tonic&#x2014;her drink&#x2014;was on the bar before her.</p><p>&#x201c;How I missed you,&#x201d; she said. He was the most loyal friend she had ever known.</p><p>He looked at her, his eyes as tender and pained as ever. &#x201c;I missed you, too,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Am I dead?&#x201d; she asked. Everything seemed so solid, so real. </p><p>&#x201c;Afraid so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Afraid? I daresay it&#x2019;s about time. Cheers.&#x201d; She drank her cocktail and it felt exactly as it always did. How could this possibly be death? She had expected nothingness, a black eternal sleep. But perhaps this was the true heaven&#x2014;sitting at a bar with her closest friend. She avoided looking into the light.</p><p>&#x201c;Cheers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Gertrude?&#x201d; she asked, glancing around to see if his wife was lurking nearby.</p><p>He pointed upward.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; Mrs. Parker said. &#x201c;Where else would she be? St. Gertrude Aquinas. Lecturing the angels, no doubt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was a good woman, Dot. Better than I deserved.&#x201d;</p><p>She took a quick glance upward. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take good care of him, Gertrude!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been waiting patiently for me,&#x201d; he said, placing a hand on her arm.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious.&#x201d;</p><p>He stared at her, his expression fixed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s my wife.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But think of it, Fred,&#x201d; she pleaded, using her nickname for him. &#x201c;Eternity is a long time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t mind staying here until you arrived. I knew the years would seem like a moment.&#x201d;</p><p>She waited for him to say something else. But then, she had always felt like she was waiting for Mr. Benchley to say something else. Finally, she asked him for a cigarette.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, patting his chest, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So it is hell.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged, a wistfulness passing over his face. &#x201c;We had a lot of good times here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How did we wind up in the Algonquin?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Remember that book we signed for Percy?&#x201d;</p><p>She did. When Percy Coates, the hotel manager, had asked them to sign the special guest book that was supposed to offer eternity, he&#x2019;d been so earnest they&#x2019;d laughed but humored him. &#x201c;So it worked. I&#x2019;ll be damned. Where are the others?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone from our group is gone,&#x201d; he said, nodding toward the white light.</p><p>&#x201c;The little shits. They couldn&#x2019;t wait for me?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a powerful draw, Mrs. Parker.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get to see them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Woollcott and Broun were here when I arrived. Then Ross showed up and later Mr. Sherwood. We had fun for a time, but they all wanted to go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did they ask about me?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled as if he knew she would ask. &#x201c;Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t a real party without you. We all thought you&#x2019;d be here any day. Who knew you&#x2019;d outlive us all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But surely I&#x2019;m not the last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are other signatures in the book, and I suppose they&#x2019;ll pass through. But they weren&#x2019;t in our crowd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My damned luck. Always late to the party.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Finish your drink,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;ll go together.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Go?&#x201d; She tsked. &#x201c;Over my dead body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s more or less the idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leave if you must,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m staying right here.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Now, Mrs. Parker. Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re rejecting eternal peace.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in it for me?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked up, his tight brow softening as if in a trance. When he looked back at her, his eyes were wet. &#x201c;Love. Can&#x2019;t you sense it?&#x201d;</p><p>She waved away his comment. &#x201c;Where did love ever get me?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;This is different. Your parents will be there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never cared for them.&#x201d;</p><p>He took her hand. &#x201c;Alan is there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you have a head injury? Why would I want to reunite with my husband?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You loved each other.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He left me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He killed himself.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Same thing.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Benchley massaged his forehead and thought. At last he nodded and looked back into her eyes. &#x201c;He was in a lot of pain, Dot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Guess what,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re angry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m awake, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>He stood, finished the last sip of his drink, and put down his glass. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been here a long while. It&#x2019;s time for me to go.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged. &#x201c;Go, then. What are you waiting for?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You sure you won&#x2019;t change your mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good-bye, Mr. Benchley. Send my best to Gertrude.&#x201d; </p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be lonely.&#x201d;</p><p>She held up her drink. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what this is for.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Benchley kissed her on the forehead. &#x201c;See you around, pal,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Just then, she heard the high-pitched yip of a small dog and looked down to see a familiar poodle trotting toward her. &#x201c;Clich�!&#x201d; she cried, remembering he had been in her lap when she signed the book, and that when Percy wasn&#x2019;t looking she had pressed his paw onto the last page. If she was going to hang around for eternity, she had reasoned, she would want his company. How perfect that it worked. She bent over to scoop him up.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Fred!&#x201d; she cried, but it was too late. Mr. Benchley was gone.<br><br></p><p>1<br><b>2007</b><br><br></p><p><br>It was late&#x2014;well past closing&#x2014;and the Algonquin Hotel&#x2019;s tavern was shadowy and still. Angel Ruiz hesitated at the doorway, but only for a second. So what if there was a strange shimmer below the one dim light on the wall? And who cared if the Haitian guys in the kitchen had sworn they&#x2019;d seen le fant�me sitting by the bar late at night? It was his first day on the job and he refused to be scared. Besides, the staff at these old hotels always believed the places were haunted.</p><p>He clicked on the soft neon bulb over the bar and unlocked the cabinet. The drunk in room 1207&#x2014;some famous writer in hiding, they said&#x2014;had ordered three martinis and the night kitchen manager instructed Angel to mix and deliver them. &#x201c;The old man,&#x201d; she had promised, &#x201c;tips big.&#x201d;</p><p>Angel stopped and listened to the deserted quiet, feeling the silence deep inside his ears. He went back to work, gently placing what he needed on the bar.</p><p>After pouring the carefully measured gin and vermouth into the metal shaker, he held the lid tight and turned it over and back, over and back. He gave it one last shake, then filled the three fancy glasses he had placed on the tray.</p><p>The darkness played tricks on his eyes. Was that a swarm of gnats hovering near the bar or just floating dust particles? He blew them away and focused on his task.</p><p>Las aceitunas, he thought. Olives. He looked around and saw a mini refrigerator under the bar. He had to kneel to see inside and found a large round jar in the back, the green orbs floating in liquid like detached eyeballs.</p><p>Angel hated olives and hoped he wouldn&#x2019;t have to fish them out with his fingers. As he rose, he was thinking about finding a fork he could use to pluck the slimy orbs from their cold bath and how his grandfather used to pop them in his mouth like candy. Disgusting.</p><p>And then, he saw something. The tiny swarm had grown. It was now a mass of swirling dust particles floating over one of the barstools. As he stared, transfixed, they took on a recognizable shape, joining together until they weren&#x2019;t separate specks but one solid image.</p><p>The jar fell from his hand and crashed, shattering the silence. It was her&#x2014;the phantom. And right before his eyes, she became a real woman, with dark impish eyes and a small hat.</p><p>Angel jumped back, almost slipping on the wet floor. He grabbed on to the bar and froze, unable to do anything but blink at the space that had been empty only seconds ago.</p><p>&#x201c;Just as well,&#x201d; she said, peering over the bar at the olives rolling across the floor. &#x201c;He likes his martinis with a twist.&#x201d;</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. She couldn&#x2019;t be real, could she?</p><p>The apparition picked up one of the drinks he had just made and took a sip. &#x201c;Not bad . . . Angel. You may have a future here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You . . . you know my name?&#x201d; A chill danced down his spine. </p><p>She pointed a dainty finger at his name tag.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you . . . want from me?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>She tipped back the martini and finished it. Then she picked up another. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to make more of these. Cheers.&#x201d;</p><p>Angel watched as she sipped the drink, closing her eyes in delight. &#x201c;I hope you have cigarettes in that pocket,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m positively desperate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cigarettes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you tell me they&#x2019;re bad for my health, I may scream.&#x201d;</p><p>Angel pulled a pack of Marlboros from his jacket, placed it on the bar, and stood back. She looked down at the cigarettes as if she expected him to do something. Finally, she extracted one and put it between her lips.</p><p>&#x201c;A light?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He swallowed hard and took a disposable lighter from his pocket, but his hands were so damp in fear he couldn&#x2019;t get it to ignite. He tried again and again.</p><p>&#x201c;I have all the time in the world,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Literally.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, a short flame rose and he carefully leaned forward to light her cigarette. She took a long drag.</p><p>&#x201c;Delightful,&#x201d; she said, exhaling. She took another puff and blew smoke rings. Angel stared as she continued smoking and drinking. What was she?</p><p>The ghost flicked ashes into the empty martini glass, then shot him a glance and sighed, as if bored by his awe. Still smoking with her right hand, she held her left hand toward him, palm down. He looked at it, wondering what she wanted him to do.</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;Miss?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wondering if I&#x2019;m real,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So touch me.&#x201d;</p><p>Her hand was small and feminine, with fingernails filed into points. Angel lightly poked it, hoping she was nothing but air, light, and dreams. But she was solid&#x2014;flesh and blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Now that we have that out of the way,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;my request. You see that book over there, inside the case?&#x201d; She pointed to the dim wall light, and Angel noticed that the shelf it illuminated held some kind of antique book inside a glass display box. &#x201c;Please bring it here.&#x201d;</p><p>He did as he was told, stepping over the olives to approach the shelf and examine the case. It was a heavy piece, with a mahogany platform and frame. The glass panels afforded a clear view of the book inside, which was open to a page of old-fashioned signatures written with the thin ink of a fountain pen. He lifted the hinged top, removed the book, and carried it back to her, placing it carefully on the bar.</p><p>&#x201c;This,&#x201d; she said, pointing over the open page, &#x201c;is me.&#x201d;</p><p>Angel scanned the names. They were all men except for one. </p><p>&#x201c;Dorothy Parker?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;ve heard of me?&#x201d; </p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Now, when you deliver the drinks to Mr. Shriver you will bring him this as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to bring the book to him?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Am I not being clear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I mean, yes. But why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dear,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;where this book goes, I go. And I need to have a little chat with Ted Shriver. We are old acquaintances.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get in trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonsense. You&#x2019;ll come back in an hour and return the book to the shelf. No one will ever know. But first, clean up this nasty spill; it&#x2019;s never a good idea to leave a mess behind.

Nobody thought that was strange, because four diggers were jammed into each small living suite. With two eight-by-ten bedrooms feeding into a tiny sitting and kitchen area, and an even tinier bathroom, there was hardly anyplace to keep clothing, so they kept it in their bags.<br><br>Elijah shared a room with a middle-aged volunteer from Alabama named Steve Phelps. When Elijah&#x2019;s cell phone vibrated at two o&#x2019;clock, his first move was to roll up on one shoulder, turn it off, and listen to Phelps breathe.<br><br>Phelps was a sound sleeper, and he was sound asleep now. Elijah often got up to pee at night, and hadn&#x2019;t awakened anyone doing that for two weeks&#x2014;the days and the sun were exhausting, and once his roommates were familiar with his night moves, they never twitched.<br><br>When he was sure of Phelps, Elijah rolled out of bed, moving as quietly as he could. He&#x2019;d loaded all of his personal items&#x2014;wallet, passport, small cash&#x2014;into his pants the night before, so all he had to do now was get into them. His socks were already rolled into his shoes, which he would put on outside.<br><br>When he was dressed, he listened again to Phelps, then eased through the door into the sitting area. Here was the tricky part. Another of the diggers, who slept in the adjoining room, had keys to one of the dig cars&#x2014;and the keys were sitting on a radiator in his room.<br><br>Elijah stepped to the door of the other bedroom, and again, listened for a moment. Both of the men snored, which was why they&#x2019;d been put together. When he was sure that he could distinguish the separate snoring, he eased open the door (he&#x2019;d put a dab of Crisco on the hinges the night before, when the others were out) and stepped silently into the room.<br><br>The men continued to snore, which helped cover his movement as he stepped barefooted across the room and picked up the car keys. Two seconds later, he was out of the room; a minute after that, he was outside with his bags, in the cool of the Israeli night, sitting on the steps, tying his shoes, and again, listening and watching.<br><br>It had been an exciting day&#x2014;maybe somebody else had been restless?<br><br>But nothing moved anywhere on the kibbutz as far as he could tell. He&#x2019;d been through one tricky part, and now here was the second one. When his shoes were tied, he walked down to the first floor with his bags&#x2014;a nylon backpack and a leather satchel&#x2014;and around behind the dormitory to a low wooden building used to sort and classify pottery and other finds at the dig.<br><br>There were no lights inside the building. He reached into his bag, took out a large screwdriver, and pried open the door. Inside, navigating without lights, he went to a row of metal lockers, felt for the fifth handle down, and with the same screwdriver, pried open the locker door.<br><br>A stone sat on the locker shelf. He couldn&#x2019;t see it, much, but he could feel it, and it was heavy. He put it in his leather satchel, closed the locker door and the outer door.<br><br>A half hour later, Elijah the Mankato-ite sped west in a stolen car past Jezreel, where, roughly 2,850 years earlier, Jezebel the queen had been thrown out a window. Her body had been eaten by dogs&#x2014;all except for the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet&#x2014;just as predicted by the other Elijah, the prophet guy.<br><br>As they didn&#x2019;t say at the time, Bummer.<br><br>The latter-day Elijah paid no attention to Jezreel, as the former royal city was now just another stony field. Ten minutes later, he rocketed past Armageddon&#x2014;Megiddo to the locals&#x2014;where there was no battle going on, penultimate or otherwise. At Megiddo, he turned northwest toward Mount Carmel and the Mediterranean coast at Haifa.<br><br>Elijah was in a hurry: he had to be gone before the diggers got up, and some of them got up very early, at four o&#x2019;clock. He kept his foot on the floor, and the much-abused Avis rent-a-car groaned with pain. Out the passenger-side window, as he went past Megiddo, he could see the lights of Nazareth twinkling across the farm fields of the Jezreel Valley.<br><br>It was pretty, all right, but he&#x2019;d been to Israel too often to be impressed. He remembered that first naive astonishment, forty-five years earlier, when he found that the Mount of Olives was full of fake religious sites, that the Sea of Galilee was full of Diet Coke bottles, and that Jesus&#x2019; hometown was an Arab city where a good Christian could get his ass kicked if he wasn&#x2019;t careful.<br><br>Not that he didn&#x2019;t love the place, because he did. He loved all of it, from the green and blue mountains in the north to the sere desert in the south, and especially the shephelah, the Judean lowlands, and above all Jerusalem. But he loved it more like an Israeli than an American; that is, despite its faults.<br><br>The flanks of Carmel were still dark when he drove into town. He&#x2019;d leave the Avis car outside the dealership, he&#x2019;d decided, where they&#x2019;d find it when they opened at eight o&#x2019;clock. He had a legitimate set of keys for the car, but it had been rented on a credit card provided by a credulous American graduate student from Penn State. The student would be mightily pissed if Elijah lost the car. In fact, he&#x2019;d be mightily pissed if Elijah left the car outside the Avis agency, but Elijah had more important things to worry about than the feelings of grad students.<br><br>Luckily, the Avis agency wasn&#x2019;t far off Route 75, and not far from the harbor, either. He found it easily enough, dumped the car, left a message on the dashboard, and called a cab.<br><br>As he waited, he fumbled a couple of pills from a bottle that he kept in the backpack, swallowed them without water.<br><br>The cabdriver didn&#x2019;t speak much English, but Elijah had excellent Hebrew, so they got along. The cabdriver asked, &#x201c;Only that luggage?&#x201d;<br><br>Elijah had the nylon backpack and the leather duffel with brass buckles. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a day trip.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t go on the water,&#x201d; the cabdriver said over his shoulder. &#x201c;If the water grows too deep in my shower, I get seasick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never been a problem for me, though I live as far as you can get from an ocean,&#x201d; Elijah said.<br><br>&#x201c;This is in the States?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Minnesota,&#x201d; Elijah said.<br><br>The driver noticed that his fare was sweating, even in the cool of the early morning. He also had the expensive leather bag clenched in his lap, as though it might contain an atomic bomb. The driver didn&#x2019;t ask.<br><br>Strange things happened in Israel every day of the week, and asking could be dangerous. Though in this case, the driver thought, danger was unlikely: the man wore a black snap-brimmed hat, a white clerical collar under his black polyester suit, and he had an olive-wood cross hanging from a silver chain around his neck.<br><br>He was a type. He would have been a type anywhere, but in Israel, he was really a type. Give a guy a black suit, a clerical collar, a wooden cross, and a sick, screaming baby, and he could walk through any checkpoint in Israel with his socks full of cocaine or C-4. Because he was an annoying, proselytizing, American Christian type&#x2014;the kind who usually came with slightly noxious religious and political opinions, and who was almost always chintzy with the tips.<br><br>Though not in this case. The driver dropped Elijah at the Fisherman&#x2019;s Anchorage at HaKishon, the mouth of the Kishon River, and Elijah gave him a hundred-shekel note, which was way too much. He didn&#x2019;t ask for change, simply hustled away, the pack on his back and the leather bag clutched in his arms, like a sick baby.<br><br>Elijah had been to the port four days earlier, where he&#x2019;d found the people he&#x2019;d been looking for: a German couple, drifting around the Med on an ancient fiberglass sailboat with an engine that worked some of the time. He&#x2019;d offered them five hundred dollars to transport him, without questions, across the water to the Old Port at Limassol on the Greek half of Cyprus.<br><br>The Germans had been reduced to eating pilchards fished from the dirty port waters and cooked over an alcohol stove, so a little human smuggling wasn&#x2019;t really a central ethical problem for them. The woman, a lanky blonde named Gerta, told him that she could provide carnal entertainment during the trip for an extra two hundred, but Elijah declined, citing conservative religious values.<br><br>When Elijah arrived on the dock, the Germans were awake and waiting, perhaps nervous that their five hundred dollars had gone somewhere else.<br><br>Gerta&#x2019;s partner, also lanky and blond, but improbably called Ricardo, pushed them off the dock within thirty seconds of his arrival. He fired up the engine, which coughed loudly before resuming its silence. Ricardo whacked it a couple of times, and got it running well enough to get them out into open water, where the Germans launched the sails.<br><br>Ricardo said, &#x201c;Such a nice day for sailing. Should I put your bags below?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, they make a place to sit,&#x201d; Elijah said, in German. His German, like his Hebrew, was excellent, and their English was no better than the cabdriver&#x2019;s, so it was what they had. He sat on his pack and clutched the leather bag in his lap.<br><br>&#x201c;So you are carrying your valuables there,&#x201d; Ricardo said, as Haifa slowly lowered itself on the horizon. He was eyeing Elijah&#x2019;s bag as a great white shark might examine a dog-paddling fat lady.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but I&#x2019;m afraid some of them will have to go over the side before we get to the Old Port,&#x201d; Elijah said.<br><br>&#x201c;Over the side?&#x201d; Ricardo was puzzled.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, over the side,&#x201d; Elijah said. He pulled an older-looking Beretta 92F from the bag, a gun that may have migrated from Iraq to Israel, looking for work. It fit well in Elijah&#x2019;s rugged hand, a hand that might have seen an early life throwing bales of hay onto a horse-drawn wagon. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a shame, because it is a fine piece of weaponry. Fast, powerful, and accurate.&#x201d;<br><br>The muzzle was not pointed at Ricardo, but neither was it pointed far away. Ricardo, who&#x2019;d been sitting unnecessarily close to the reverend&#x2014;for Elijah was indeed an ordained minister in the Lutheran Church in America&#x2014;eased away. &#x201c;Perhaps not over the side,&#x201d; Ricardo said. &#x201c;When we get to the port, I could find a place to put it.&#x201d;<br><br>Such a fine piece of weaponry would sell for a couple of thousand dollars on the right stretch of the Med, Elijah thought, and come to no good end.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Elijah said.<br><br>And perhaps not.<br><br>The trip took all that day, the next night, and most of the following day. The winds were perfect: strong enough to give them a good run, but not so overwhelming that the seas got trashy. Elijah spent the time on deck, reading books on an iPad, wrapped in a nylon rain suit during the cool of the night. He&#x2019;d come prepared.<br><br>When Cyprus hove in sight, and when Ricardo was preoccupied with getting the engine started again, Elijah dropped the pistol over the side. As they came into the marina area, Ricardo, who&#x2019;d properly understood the display of the pistol as a counter to any possible ambitions concerning the reverend&#x2019;s valuables, asked about the gun.<br><br>&#x201c;Fell over the side,&#x201d; Elijah said. And, &#x201c;I think the man on the dock is trying to get your attention.&#x201d;<br><br>Dockside, they told their story: Elijah Jones was an American who&#x2019;d joined his German friends for a sail in the Med, but who&#x2019;d unexpectedly begun urinating blood and was in great pain. Elijah explained that he was dying of colon cancer, and was making a last trip around the eastern Mediterranean to say good-bye to friends in Greece, Egypt, and Israel. Now he just wanted to get home to Mankato, Minnesota, so he could die in peace.<br><br>He would need to stop at the local hospital, he said, and then go on his way. As proof of his condition, he showed the customs man his bag of medications and a treatment letter from his physician at the Mayo Clinic.<br><br>He was also sweating and stifling groans, and as the customs officials conferred over his documents, he asked to be excused to the dockside, where he promptly peed blood into the Mediterranean Sea. The chief customs agent stamped his passport and expressed the wish that God would bless him.<br><br>Twenty minutes after they reached the port, Elijah was on his way to Larnaca International; six hours later, on his way to Charles de Gaulle in Paris, and six hours after landing there, on his way to Minneapolis.<br><br>At Minneapolis, two uniformed paramedics, one male and one female, were waiting in the customs area. Elijah, sweating like a boxcar loader, was pushed into the baggage area in a wheelchair. The customs guys asked him if he had anything to declare, he groaned, &#x201c;No.&#x201d; A drug dog gave him a perfunctory sniff, and they waved him through to the EMS techs and the waiting ambulance.<br><br>The male paramedic carried his bags, and joked, &#x201c;What you got in here, a rock?&#x201d;<br><br>Ninety minutes after that, Elijah checked into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, and told the techs to put his duffel bag on the floor by the bed.<br><br>Three days later, when his condition had again been stabilized, and he was no longer peeing blood, he checked himself out.<br><br>But he didn&#x2019;t tell anybody. He just walked.<br><br>With the heavy leather bag.<br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>It was one of the great Minnesota summers of all time&#x2014;or maybe it just felt that way, after one of the most miserable springs in history. On April 22, in a nasty little snowstorm, he&#x2019;d skidded off a highway in Apple Valley, and had had to call for a tow to get his four-wheel-drive truck out of the ditch.<br><br>On May 1, he&#x2019;d gone north to a friend&#x2019;s cabin near Hayward, Wisconsin, to do some early-season fly-fishing for bluegills, and it had snowed the whole day, and the day after that, totaling sixteen inches of the stuff, and then it had spent two days raining old women and sticks, as the Welsh would say, although they&#x2019;d actually say something more like mae hi&#x2019;n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn.<br><br>But the summer . . . ah, the summer, which was now coming to its peak, the summer was a joy to behold, even from the inside of a diner.<br><br>Virgil Flowers was sitting sideways in a booth in a Perkins restaurant on Highway 169 in Mankato, Minnesota, his cowboy boots hanging off the end of the seat. He was talking to Florence &#x201c;Ma&#x201d; Nobles about her involvement in a counterfeit lumber ring, of which she denied any knowledge. He&#x2019;d been investigating her for a while, and had even met three of her five intra-ethnic fatherless boys&#x2014;Mateo, Tall Bear, and Moses.<br><br>Virgil picked up a french fry and jabbed it at her: &#x201c;Dave Moss said you sold the same barn fifteen times, Ma. He says your boy Rolf has another two thousand board-feet of lumber down at the bottom of the Minnesota River, getting old. Dave says you&#x2019;ll be peddling that all over New England next year.&#x201d;<br><br>Ma made a rude noise with her lips, and Virgil said, &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Ma, that&#x2019;s not necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>Ma said, &#x201c;That goddamn Moss can kiss my ass&#x2014;though, to be honest, he already did that and seemed to like it all right. This is more a domestic dispute than anything else, Virgie. I broke it off with him, and he&#x2019;s just getting back at me.&#x201d;<br><br>Virgil said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can believe that, Ma. There&#x2019;s a fellow named Barry Spurgeon who spent forty-four thousand dollars buying lumber from your boy, so he can build some sort of a barn-mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. He got suspicious and did a tree-ring test and that tree was cut down last year. Last year, for Christ&#x2019;s sakes, Ma. You didn&#x2019;t even let it go five years. Spurgeon wants that money back because he paid for real old-timey barn lumber.&#x201d;<br><br>His phone rang and he picked it up and looked at it: Lucas Davenport.<br><br>&#x201c;I gotta take this,&#x201d; he said. He pushed the &#x201c;answer&#x201d; tab on the phone and said, &#x201c;Hang on a minute, Lucas,&#x201d; and to Ma, &#x201c;You sit right here.

From the blue-blooded pockets of old-WASP New England to the vast tribal lands of the Navajo, Bryan Sykes takes us on a historical genetic tour, interviewing genealogists, geneticists, anthropologists, and everyday Americans with compelling ancestral stories. His findings suggest:<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Of Americans whose ancestors came as slaves, virtually all have some European DNA.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Racial intermixing appears least common among descendants of early New England colonists.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� There is clear evidence of Jewish genes among descendants of southwestern Spanish Catholics.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Among white Americans, evidence of African DNA is most common in the South.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� European genes appeared among Native Americans as early as ten thousand years ago.<br><br> An unprecedented look into America's genetic mosaic and how we perceive race, <em>DNA USA</em> challenges the very notion of what we think it means to be American. 8 pages of color illustrations; 8 pages of black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, pioneered the use of DNA in exploring the human past. He is the author of Saxons, Vikings, and Celts and the&nbsp;New York Times bestseller The Seven Daughters of Eve.&#x201c;Starred review. Human genetics energetically elucidated, entertaining travel writing, the fascinating personal stories of DNA volunteers, and Sykes&#x2019; candid musings on his awakening to the complex emotional and social implications of hidden biological inheritances make for a milestone book guaranteed to ignite spirited discussion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Donna Seaman, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Starred review. Sykes combines history, science, travel and memoir in one grand exposition of what it means to be an &#x201c;American.&#x201d; In a graceful text, the author delivers rich images of the American landscape, conversations with strangers, and historic asides on the waves of immigration, the Indian diasporas and the various federal laws that shaped the movements of people across the continent. ...Sykes should also be applauded for his skills as a storyteller, science expositor, travel companion and compassionate human being.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An authority on ancient DNA analysis, Sykes provides a nontechnical introduction to how Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA may be used to reveal ancestral heritage. Combining in-depth interviews with volunteers along with these genetic techniques, he attempts to create a biological portrait of the United States. Using a travel diary approach to describe his three-month coast-to-coast journey, he introduces the people he meets and reflects on how ancestry and heredity play into our culture, customs, and beliefs. While Sykes acknowledges that the sample is too small to draw significant conclusions, the results provide interesting perspectives on life in early America... These DNA portraits illustrate the complexity of human inheritance and how difficult it is to assign individuals to distinct groups.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As the author of <em>The Seven Daughters of Eve</em> and other books, Sykes is an old hand at writing about genetics for the general public. His experience shows as he deftly introduces highly technical information in reader-friendly ways... During his journey, Sykes encounters people who embrace DNA testing as a way to clear up messy genealogical records. He also meets skeptics, who see the technology as a way to discredit their cultural heritage. Sykes doesn&#x2019;t shy away from these criticisms, presenting a well-balanced view of the disparate attitudes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tina Hesman Saey, <em>ScienceNews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It may seem odd for the author of a book on human genetics and heredity to thank his travel agent in the acknowledgments, but in the case of this hybrid work of science and cross-country reportage it&#x2019;s a fitting gesture... Sykes writes lucidly, creating his own unique mixture in a book that might be described as <em>Travels With Charley</em> meets <em>The Double Helix</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Abigail Meisel, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><h2>Container Gardening: Design Ideas for Rooftops, Balconies, Terraces, and More</h2><p>Enhanced with more than two hundred photographs and illustrations, this updated gardening handbook explains the fundamentals of container gardening, describing suitable plants and suggesting ways of displaying them as furnishings for house and garden.

Leaping at this chance to be a mountain man, with no experience in the wilds, he left the world. Thirteen years later, he published his beloved memoir of that winter, <i>Indian Creek Chronicles &#x2015;Into the Wild</i> with a twist. </p><p>Twenty five years later, he was asked to return to the wilderness to babysit more fish eggs. But no longer a footloose twenty year old, at forty-five, he was the father of two young sons. He left again, alone, straight into the heart of Montana&#x2019;s Bob Marshall wilderness, walking a daily ten mile loop to his fish eggs through deer and elk and the highest density of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. </p><p><i>The Names of the Stars</i> is not only a story of wilderness and bears but also a trek through a life lived at its edges, showing how an impulsive kid transformed into a father without losing his love for the wilds. From loon calls echoing across Northwood lakes to the grim realities of life guarding in the Nevada desert, through the isolation of Indian Creek and years spent running the Snake and Rio Grande as a river ranger, Pete seeks out the source of this passion for wildness, as well as explores fatherhood and mortality and all the costs and risks and rewards of life lived on its own terms.</p></p><p>PETE FROMM is a five time winner of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Award for his novels <i>If Not For This</i>, <i>As Cool as I Am</i>, and <i>How All This Started</i>, his story collection <i>Dry Rain</i>, and the memoir <i>Indian Creek Chronicles</i>.

In Fromm&#x2019;s hands, a violent rainstorm reads like a transcendent gift and a face-to-face bear encounter like good comedy.

Eleven chapters subtly suggest a distinction between life and legend. Mayo begins with biography and proceeds with the well-known stories of how Francis tamed a wolf, talked to the birds, and organized the first living cr?che. These are followed by lesser-known tales, a simplified version of The Canticle of Brother Sun, information about the canonization, and the 1997 earthquake that destroyed much of the Basilica of San Francesco. Malone's paintings combine elements from illuminated manuscripts and frescoes by Giotto with invented, playful cameos united through scale, palette, and subject. The overall effect is of an enactment of a medieval mystery play, with the saint, his family, and followers as central characters. The sun and the moon also appear, at times as heavenly bodies, or as costumed actors or musicians, depending on the scene. The only image that disrupts the flow is the procession to the first nativity. Other sources place the scene in a cave. Here it is a church-one that looks like a modern structure. The brief bits of dialogue are similar to those found in other biographies; Mayo does offer some information on sources, including an allusion to Francis's own writings, but direct documentation is not provided. The art creates a medieval setting quite effectively; the generous use of white space between the relatively simple sentences makes the content accessible to a range of readers. Consider this one even if you have other titles about this popular saint.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Dauphin County Library, Harrisburg, PA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Malone's (The Magic Flute) magnificently detailed illustrations are the highlight of this attractive volume, which tells of the perennially popular Francis of Assisi (1182-1226), the son of a wealthy merchant who went on to take a vow of poverty and ascended to sainthood. Beginning with a sketchy biography, Mayo (How to Count Crocodiles) adds several legends about St. Francis. Unfortunately, the biographical section may raise more questions than it answers. For instance, most biographers agree that Francis's yearlong imprisonment was a time of epiphany, but Mayo's account is confusing ("After a long illness, Francis returned to his old life of luxury and pleasure. Illness and prison had changed him though, so that now he would sometimes walk alone in the hills, thinking and praying"). While the biographical section fails to capture the charisma of both Francis the indulged youth and Francis the convert, his magnetic qualities come through more clearly in the legends that follow (especially in "How Francis Tamed a Ferocious Wolf" and "The Ox, the Ass and the Child of Bethlehem"). Supplied in abundance, Malone's exquisite vignettes and spot illustrations, inspired by Italian frescoes, do more than the text to characterize the saint. His Francis possesses an accessible yet otherworldly quality, whether singing beneath a crescent moon as a man born to affluence, riding off to war in his stately armor or praying in the ruined church of San Damiano. By the time readers find St. Francis's own "Canticle of Brother Sun," included at the end, they'll know how to appreciate it. Ages 10-up.

Ted Morgan discusses America through the prism of his own experience: he was a French aristocrat, Sanche de Gramont, who became Ted Morgan and an American citizen in 1977, he settled on a name that conformed with the language and cultural norms of American society, a name that telephone operators and desk clerks could hear without flinching. A Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, Morgan&#39;s experience illustrates why immigration is central to the American experience. He sees us with fresh eyes, and writes with humor about our passion for fast cars, fast food and the freedom we take for granted. &#34;An antidote to facile put downs of America. Morgan makes the case that America is the greatest success story the world has ever known.

Ami lives outside of Chicago with her family. This is her first novel.<br>Gr 6 Up In this sweet and thoughtful debut, an introverted sixth grader begins to come into her own as a transgender girl. Grayson was orphaned in preschool and lives with her aunt and uncle in Chicago. She's becoming more and more aware of a nagging feeling that she should be living as a girl, despite being male-assigned, and on a daring whim decides to audition for the part of Persephone in the school play. She has a supportive teacher and a new friend, but also has to contend with school bullies and disapproving adults. The writing is clear and effortless, with a straightforward plot and likable characters. Grayson is a charming narrator who balances uncertainty with clarity, bravery with anxiety. This title has less obvious and didactic intent than other novels featuring transgender protagonists. A welcome addition to a burgeoning genre. Kyle Lukoff, Corlears School, New York City SLJ"<br><br>Sixth-grader Grayson realizes a dream but attracts controversy by taking the role of the female lead in the school play. When Grayson was younger, it was easier to look in the mirror and see "the long shining golden gown and the girl inside of it." Now, in sixth grade, "[m]y imagination doesn't work like it used to." (The book's first-person narration neatly avoids the problem of choosing gendered pronouns for Grayson, who is perceived as male by classmates but whose identity as female sharpens over the course of the novel.) The story takes time to get started: Grayson gains and then loses her first new friend in years; then Grayson's grandmother dies; and then, about a quarter of the way in, the school-play plot that quickly becomes central begins. Grayson's doodles of princesses and daydreams of skirts sometimes feel a clumsily obvious way to indicate that gender is the issue here. In fact, many characters feel more like stand-ins for certain ideas (Grayson's aunt's resistance to Grayson playing Persephone, Grayson's younger cousin's childlike insistence that "[i]t's just a play") than fully imagined people. Still, Grayson's journey is portrayed with gentleness and respect, and readers will root for the show to go on. A kind and earnest look at a young transgender adolescent's experience. (Fiction. 10-14) Kirkus"<br><br>Grayson, a sixth grader at Porter Middle School, passes the time doodling and daydreaming about what it would be like to go through life as a girl, despite being seen by everyone else as male. Struggling with the total isolation that comes with harboring a secret, Grayson keeps people at a distance until Amelia moves to town. The two develop a friendship that awakens Grayson's need for companionship and acceptance. When that friendship falls apart, Grayson tries out for (and lands) the female lead in the school play as a means of testing out a female persona. Facing abuse and derision from classmates and resistance from members of her adoptive family (both birth parents were killed years before), Grayson fights for the right to present her truest self to the people around her-both on and off the stage. Luckily, an invested teacher and several open-minded cast mates offer understanding and support as Grayson begins to sort out the complexities of her own identity. Polonsky captures the loneliness of a child resigned to disappear rather than be rejected, and then the courageous risk that child eventually takes to be seen for who she is. The first-person narration successfully positions readers to experience Grayson's confusion, fear, pain, and triumphs as they happen, lending an immediate and intimate feel to the narrative. shara l. hardeson Horn Book"<br><br>Sixth-grader Grayson Sender quietly doodles princess and castles with glitter pens during class and dreams of wearing twirly skirts and long, shiny gowns instead of his limp, lifeless track pants. Those aren't problems, but the fact that he has to repress himself is a problem-a big one. Despite knowing that he is a girl deep down inside, Grayson has learned to look and act like the boy he is not; his family would be furious and his classmates would bully him if they found out. But now, cast as Persephone in the spring play, he finds acceptance among the cast members. Thoughtfully told through Grayson's eyes, the story conveys his angst, hurt, loss, and emerging confidence as he struggles with a whirlwind of emotions. His new friends allow him to find the courage to become who "she" really is, and we are privileged to watch the transformation take place. With great courage, Polonsky's debut novel reminds us with much sensitivity that we are all unique and deserve to become who we are meant to be. Jeanne Fredriksen Booklist"<br><br>Sixth-grader Grayson has ways of getting by-he doodles abstract triangles instead of the princesses he yearns to be, and he wears oversize T-shirts and loose pants instead of the skirts and dresses he longs for. Grayson's aunt and uncle worry about his isolation (his parents died when he was small), and they are thrilled when he makes his first friend in years and tries out for the school play. They're less thrilled to learn he auditioned for the lead role-the Greek goddess Persephone. Debut author Polonsky uses the play effectively, showing the community that builds among the actors, Grayson's connection to Persephone and her underground captivity, and the tensions swirling around the casting choice and the play's director, a popular teacher who may or may not be gay. Polonsky skillfully conveys Grayson's acute loneliness and his growing willingness to open up about who he is, though the book has a dutiful feel in its efforts to raise awareness about gender nonconforming and transgender preteens. Ages 10 14. PW"<br><br>4Q 4P M J Sixth-grader Grayson Sender has lived with his aunt and uncle ever since his parents died in a car accident, and has harbored a deep, dark secret from them and the rest of the world. He secretly imagines that his track pants are flowing skirts, that his long hair is pulled back with ribbons and barrettes, and that the shapes he doodles during school are pictures of princesses. Grayson's secret is something that his parents knew, but they are gone. His new family is less accepting of the fact that, even though born a boy, deep down inside, he is a girl. When he summons the courage to try out for a female role in the school play, Grayson finds out just how unaccepting people can be. Polonsky's first novel is a triumph. It is well written, insightful, and true to the world of middle school, beginning with Grayson doodling in class and trying to remain as anonymous as possible in school. When he is noticed, it is to be teased and bullied, even by his cousin Jack, who used to be his friend. Grayson is lonely and alone as he slowly comes to accept who and what he is, and takes baby steps toward expressing that true self to the rest of the world. It seems utterly realistic heartbreaking and uplifting at once. This is an excellent choice for a middle school classroom discussion.-Laura Lehner. VOYA"<br><br>Grayson's sure that if he could just find a way, he could strip off his ill-fitting male self and become the girl he was always meant to be. An uncharacteristically brave moment during an audition and a forward-thinking teacher willing to take a risk means that Grayson lands the role of Persephone in a school play. The ensuing controversy doesn't keep Grayson from the role, but it does shake up the town in permanent ways. Grayson is an endearing narrator of his own life as he moves from quiet doodler waiting for some magical moment to a determined kid who realizes he can just make his own. Unfortunately, there isn't much depth to the characters who surround him, and their flat rejection or immediate acceptance of Grayson end up being devoid of realistic complexity. In addition, a resources or further reading list would have been useful, particularly as the young intended audience isn't likely to have read much about transgender preteens before. Nevertheless, this is a well-intentioned, warm look at a kid who finds a voice that feels true for the first time, and for that reason, many readers may find this to be a memorable read.

Illustrated with watercolors and family photographs, this book makes an ideal read-aloud.</p><p>Imagine the excitement of rooting around in an old attic and discovering the letters, diaries, and photo albums of a relative. What if that memorabilia opened a window on the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, the most famous sea disaster of all time? That's exactly what happened to Leighton H. Coleman III. Exploring the attic of his relative Daisy Corning Stone Spedden, he found many personal treasures, including a charming book Daisy had written for her 8-year-old son, Douglas, in 1913. This story, combined with award-winning artist Laurie McGaw's gorgeous watercolor illustrations, actual family photographs, keepsakes, and historic postcards, weaves the fabric of <i>Polar the Titanic Bear</i>, an engaging slice of history for all ages, told through the black glass eyes of an extraordinary toy bear named Polar.<p> The story begins in the toy workshop where Polar is born, and quickly moves to the point where he is given to "Master," Daisy Spedden's son Douglas. Soon the boy and bear are inseparable! As the wealthy Speddens are world travelers, Polar and his new family sail from New York to Algiers and on to the French Riviera, until it comes time for them to return to America on the <i>Titanic</i>. On the fateful night of the sinking, Polar and the Speddens are lucky enough to be lowered down the side of the luxury liner in a lifeboat, but when the family boards the rescue ship, Polar finds himself left behind! How will Polar make it back to his best friend? </p><p> In the epilogue, rich with family photographs, the historical context for the story is fully and engagingly explained, with more details on the <i>Titanic</i> disaster as well as a smattering of toy history. This is a wonderful gift book--the richness and emotion of the story are all the more poignant when enhanced by the Spedden family photographs, their tragic personal story, and the reflection of an era that will never exist again. (All ages ... excellent for reading aloud to ages 6 and older, but perfect for 9- to 12-year-olds, too.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Daisy Corning Stone Spedden penned the manuscript for <i>Polar, The Titanic Bear</i> for her son, Douglas, after the family survived the Titanic disaster in 1912. The original booklet was found, among other items, by Leighton H. Coleman III, a distant relation of the Spedden family, in his grandfather's barn. After sending a copy of the story to the Titanic Historical Society, it came to the attention of Madison Press Books, who eventually published the story with Little, Brown and Company.<br>Laurie McGaw is well known for her portraits of renowned figures as well as her award-winning illustrations in <i>Polar The Titanic Bear </i>and <i>African Princess</i>.

After 1918, the immense movement of people across Germany's eastern border posed a sharp challenge to the new Weimar Republic. Ethnic Germans flooded over the border from the new Polish state, Russian �migr�s poured into the German capital, and East European Jews sought protection in Germany from the upheaval in their homelands. Nor was the movement in one direction only: German Freikorps sought to found a soldiers' colony in Latvia, and a group of German socialists planned to settle in a Soviet factory town.</p><p>In <i>The Impossible Border,</i> Annemarie H. Sammartino explores these waves of migration and their consequences for Germany. Migration became a flashpoint for such controversies as the relative importance of ethnic and cultural belonging, the interaction of nationalism and political ideologies, and whether or not Germany could serve as a place of refuge for those seeking asylum. Sammartino shows the significance of migration for understanding the difficulties confronting the Weimar Republic and the growing appeal of political extremism.</p><p>Sammartino demonstrates that the moderation of the state in confronting migration was not merely by default, but also by design. However, the ability of a republican nation-state to control its borders became a barometer for its overall success or failure. Meanwhile, debates about migration were a forum for political extremists to develop increasingly radical understandings of the relationship between the state, its citizens, and its frontiers. The widespread conviction that the democratic republic could not control its "impossible" Eastern borders fostered the ideologies of those on the radical right who sought to resolve the issue by force and for all time.</p></p><p><p>Annemarie H. Sammartino is Associate Professor of History at Oberlin College.</p><p>"In <i>The Impossible Border</i>, Annemarie H. Sammartino offers an important and fascinating study of the history of migration across Weimar Germany's eastern border. In so doing, she addresses a number of key aspects of the history of Weimar Germany: settlement policy, emigration and immigration, how Jews and attitudes toward Jews were affected by border crossings, and the ways in which Germans imagined their eastern neighbors."</p> (Richard Bessel, University of York, author of <i>Germany after the First World War</i> and <i>Germany 1945: From War to Peace</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Impossible Border</i> is an excellent book. Annemarie H.

By the author of The Sorcerer&#39;s Curse.</p><p>Okay, it&#39;s a retelling of the French Revolution, but there&#39;s magic in this story. You know what&#39;s going to happen by page 3, though some of the particulars differ. The familiar-seeming background makes the sorcery-touched story that much more engrossing. Read this for Volsky&#39;s wonderful fillips of detail, which make her story live and breathe, and read it for her engaging characters: Eliste&#39;s education in the gilded palace of the Beviaire and in the streets of Shereen, Dref Zeenoson&#39;s rise, ingenious Uncle Quinz&#39;s illusions. But watch out: it&#39;s nearly impossible to stop reading this absorbing, densely-plotted novel, and that&#39;s the real magic.Give the Russian Revolution a French ambiance, add a dollop of American spirit and a dash of magic--and you have some idea of the setting for this bulky but entertaining historical fantasy. Young, purblind country Exalted (aristocrat) Eliste refuses to recognize her feelings for the handsome, educated, mannerly, admirable Dref--the latter, you see, is a serf, virtually a slave; and soon, when he defies Eliste's vicious father, Dref is forced to flee. So Eliste journeys to the city Sherreen to meet the King and Queen, where, preoccupied by the lustfully prolonged and unwelcome attentions of the King's brother, she fails to notice that the underclasses are threatening rebellion--until a mob bursts in to sack the palace. Whereupon the triumphant rabble-rouser Whiss Valeur institutes, with magical help, a reign of terror whose victims include not only the King and hapless Exalteds but anyone who dares oppose him. Only after a terrified Eliste endures dreadful privations and near-death will she throw off her aristocratic ways, meet up with Dref (a steadfast democrat, leading the resistance), and summon up some potent magical aid of her own to defeat the unspeakable Whiss. Surprisingly absorbing and agreeable, given the stereotyped characters and general air of predictability, with unobtrusive yet well thought-out magical notions and a backdrop of genuine depth and consistency. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She was born and raised in Chatham, Ontario, and now makes her home in Los Angeles with her husband and two children.The Mountain Story <br> <br>BEFORE<br> <br>My boyhood home on Old Dewey Road stood among similar clapboard bungalows in the older, grimier section of Mercury, upwind of Michigan&#x2019;s largest rendering plant, with the train tracks near enough that I could distinguish passenger from freight by the way the house shook. A year and a half after my mother&#x2019;s accident&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what we called it&#x2014;my father briefly got sober and painted the entire house, inside and out, a dark, flat blue. Drowning Man Blue. Frankie said it was a tribute to Glory. She loved the color blue.<br> <br>Frankie said I was too young, only four years old when she passed away, to have an honest recollection of my mother, but I do. Glory Elizabeth Truly. In my favorite memory she wears a silky white dress with batwing sleeves&#x2014;one I&#x2019;ve never seen in photographs. She&#x2019;s standing in front of a dressing room mirror, smiling at our reflection, and behind us is another mirror where I discover our infinity. &#x201c;Always,&#x201d; I say. My beautiful mother laughs and tells me I&#x2019;m clever before covering my face with soft kisses and spinning me in her embrace. I glimpse us with each turn. Glory looks like an angel in that white dress.<br> <br>I remember the mornings with my mother the most, watching her get ready for work (kindergarten teacher) while Frankie (&#x201c;entrepreneur&#x201d;) slept upstairs. We talked in whispers as she made up her pretty face and spritzed her curls with lemon-scented hairspray. Before disappearing out the door, she&#x2019;d turn to smile and then lay her hand on her heart to say she kept me there, even when she was away.<br> <br>After she died, Frankie had her name tattooed on his forearm&#x2014;Glory, in a rainbow that arched over the word Always. I used to think it would have been truer if the tattoo said Glory Once or Glory Briefly or, even better, Sorry, Glory.<br> <br>I have never, to my recollection, called Frankie by any name other than his first. My ears were filled with the sound of it, usually shouted, often slurred, by the strangers who came and went from that smoke-choked blue house. Men who slammed doors and broke bottles. Women I didn&#x2019;t know cooking food I wouldn&#x2019;t eat. Children I&#x2019;d never seen playing board games I didn&#x2019;t own. I remember one time Frankie tossed me a package of gum and warned, &#x201c;Share that with your sisters.&#x201d; I turned around to find two freckled redheads I&#x2019;d never seen before sitting behind me on the couch.<br> <br>Glory Always? She was only twenty-five (Frankie a full decade older) when she died. I have my mother&#x2019;s smile, I&#x2019;ve been told, but otherwise I&#x2019;m the image of my father. I remember after a second-grade lesson about immigration, I&#x2019;d asked Frankie the details of my heritage. He told me that Glory&#x2019;s family came from England when she was a baby and that her parents, both older physicians, had died of natural causes before my mother graduated from teachers college. Frankie guessed they wouldn&#x2019;t have liked him. It did occur to me that if Glory&#x2019;s parents had lived longer, I might never have lived at all.<br> <br>When I asked about his side of the family, Frankie hesitated. He was secretive about his past, like me. &#x201c;On my father&#x2019;s side we were Trulinos until the nineteen thirties, but then my grandfather decided he wanted a more American-sounding name, so he changed it to Truly and that caused a rift and that&#x2019;s how we ended up in Michigan. On my mother&#x2019;s side we&#x2019;re French Canadian and Cree. My cousins came down to visit us from Quebec one time. They were dark and lean. Badass. I take after my mother&#x2019;s side. That&#x2019;s how come I&#x2019;m so stealthy. Why I like my feet bare.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was this rotting cedar porch out front of our blue house from which I&#x2019;d leap as a boy&#x2014;towel-cape aflutter behind me&#x2014;shouting, &#x201c;I am Batman,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I am Superman,&#x201d; but I remember one day I lost my cape, and I&#x2019;d simply shouted, &#x201c;I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ME!&#x201d; Frankie slammed his palm on the kitchen table and hollered through the open window, &#x201c;That kinda arrogance&#x2019;ll take you to Cleveland, Wolf! Cleveland and back!&#x201d; Whether he meant to encourage, mock, or scold me, I still have no clue. My father has left me, my whole life, in a state of wonder.<br> <br>One spring day when I was thirteen, Frankie stood up from the kitchen table and announced, &#x201c;We need to be near family now,&#x201d; like the tragedy of my mother&#x2019;s death was ten days, and not nearly ten years, old.<br> <br>&#x201c;What family?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re moving to California. This summer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll stay with Kriket till we get on our feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d never been to California and neither had Frankie. I&#x2019;d never met his sister Kriket (Katherine) and never knew them to be close.<br> <br>I figured Frankie had gotten himself into some kind of trouble in Mercury, a debt he couldn&#x2019;t repay, or maybe he&#x2019;d slept with somebody&#x2019;s wife or girlfriend or sister or mother. You wouldn&#x2019;t think women would go for an unemployed widower in a stained concert T-shirt, but there were plenty of pretty girls around to finger the rainbow on Frankie&#x2019;s Glory Always tattoo. &#x201c;I reek of pheromones,&#x201d; he told me once, flapping his hands around his armpits, encouraging me to take a whiff.<br> <br>We made a plan to head for Kriket&#x2019;s place in the California desert in late July. Frankie was vague when I asked about the future of the little blue house. (Later he told me he&#x2019;d lost it in a bet.) He bulldozed Glory&#x2019;s toiletries from their bathroom shelf shrine&#x2014;the lemon-scented hairspray, prescription ointment for a patch of eczema, an unopened box of decongestant to relieve her springtime allergies&#x2014;and threw them all into the trash.<br> <br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t need all this where we&#x2019;re going, Wolf,&#x201d; he said, which made me wonder why we&#x2019;d needed it where we were.<br> <br>I spent a lot of time at the Mercury Public Library when I was kid. Frankie sent me there to borrow books by way of free babysitting. Miss Kittle was the head librarian, a buttoned-up brunette who, along with the rest of the staff, barely tolerated me. I couldn&#x2019;t blame them. I stole doughnuts from the seniors&#x2019; meetings, made a mess of the shelves, and spent far too much time in the men&#x2019;s room. Still, I loved the library. I loved books. I especially loved plump, berry-scented Miss Kittle.<br> <br>A few weeks before we left for the desert, Miss Kittle surprised me by calling out my name when I walked through the library doors. &#x201c;Wolf Truly!&#x201d;<br> <br>There was something different about Miss Kittle&#x2014;her cheeks were pinker and her lips were glossed and her thick dark hair fell in waves over her shoulders. By the look of her face I wasn&#x2019;t in trouble, which confused me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have something for you, Wolf,&#x201d; she said. Miss Kittle had never spoken directly to me before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard you were moving to Santa Sophia.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes were even prettier up close. &#x201c;My aunt Kriket lives there,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from,&#x201d; Miss Kittle said. &#x201c;My father still lives there. I visit every summer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;California&#x2019;s a long way from Michigan.&#x201d; My cheeks were hot.<br> <br>&#x201c;I had to move up here to help take care of my grandmother. I miss the desert.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss winter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; she said, raising her index finger. Then she reached beneath the counter and drew out a large, heavy book. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t have to miss winter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have the mountain,&#x201d; she said, passing me the hefty book. &#x201c;The Mountain in the Desert.&#x201d;<br> <br>The moment I glimpsed the photograph on the cover&#x2014;a helicopter shot of the pine-rimmed granite peak&#x2014;I knew that mountain contained my destiny. The details leaped from the pages like some 3-D d�j� vu: ten thousand feet at the summit; mother of the transverse mountain ranges; hundreds of miles of pristine wilderness; hunting ground of the Agua Caliente band of Native Americans; habitat of bighorn sheep, mountain lions, rattlesnakes; precipitation ten times higher than what falls in the desert below; torrential rains in spring and fall, blizzards in winter. It was a place I&#x2019;d never heard of but felt that I&#x2019;d already been.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to climb to the peak,&#x201d; Miss Kittle said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That looks pretty high.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You take the tram most of the way,&#x201d; she said, turning to the back of the book and pointing to a full-page photograph. &#x201c;The ride up is almost vertical. Look.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was.<br> <br>&#x201c;This tramcar takes you from the Desert Station&#x2014;the climate of Mexico&#x2014;to the Mountain Station&#x2014;the climate of northern Canada&#x2014;in less than twenty minutes. Palms to pines.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can climb to the peak from there. I only made it once,&#x201d; she confessed. &#x201c;It was cloudy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Too bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll try again when I&#x2019;m in Palm Springs this summer to visit my father,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You should.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll see if you and your dad want to come with me. Frankie&#x2014;right?&#x201d; She blushed.<br> <br>Oh no, I thought. Frankie never came into the library, so I couldn&#x2019;t imagine where the two had met. &#x201c;Frankie. That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br> &#x201c;Do you know where in Santa Sophia your aunt lives?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Verdi Village,&#x201d; I said, remembering what Frankie told me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds familiar. I think it&#x2019;s gated.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew nothing about gates.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most of the gated places have golf.&#x201d;<br> <br>VERDI VILLAGE did not have golf. Or gates. Or shimmering pools. Or tennis courts. Or decorative fountains. Or paved roads for that matter. Santa Sophia was a tidy desert town consisting of mostly guarded, affluent communities. But past the mission-style shopping malls, and beyond the fuchsia bougainvillea and the median beds of white aggregate and flowering cacti, and over the abandoned train tracks, thousands populated the thrice-foreclosed-upon Verdi Village mobile home development that bled out over two square miles of hard-baked, treeless earth.<br> <br>The original double-wide, pitch-roofed aluminum trailers were run-down, but at least they still had electricity and running water, unlike the second strata of mobile housing grown from the seeds of Airstream and Coachmen and Four Winds. Past that, the vagabonds had erected a haphazard crust of shacks and shanties, shelter for economic refugees, the mentally ill, and bikers. Locals called the place Tin Town.<br> <br>In those dangerous narrows grew children who knew too much too young but, sadly, always seemed to learn too little too late. It was hot as hell in Tin Town&#x2014;it set the most records in the state for triple-digit temperatures. I can still smell the unwashed bodies and twice-fried sausage, cigarette smoke and cat shit; and I can hear the discontent like bad radio reception. But mostly I can feel it&#x2014;the wind, constant through the San Gorgonio Pass, polishing the earth and nourishing the groves of wind turbines along the desert roads.<br> <br>You can see those ribbons of straight white stalks from eight thousand feet up the mountain. It&#x2019;s a hell of a view.<br> <br></p><h2>LIBERAL MIND, THE</h2><p><p>Kenneth Minogue offers a brilliant and provocative exploration of liberalism in the Western world today: its roots and its influences, its present state, and its prospects in the new century. <b><i>The Liberal Mind</i></b> limns the taxonomy of a way of thinking that constitutes the very consciousness of most people in most Western countries.</p> <p>While few&#x2014;especially in America&#x2014;embrace the description of liberal, still, Minogue argues, most Americans and most Europeans behave as liberals.

The journey from birth to death is something we all share in common, regardless of how differently we choose to live our lives. For Tibetans, this human life is considered a rare and precious opportunity. Buddha said the chance for human life is as rare as a one&#x2013;eyed turtle surfacing its head through the hole of a single oxen&#x2013;yoke floating in a vast ocean. From a Buddhist point of view, among the many realms into which we may be born, only as human beings can we develop the qualities of wisdom and compassion that liberate us from deluded existence. To waste even a moment of our precious lives on destructive or self&#x2013;centered concerns is considered by Tibetans a falling away from our innermost human nature.<br> <br>We have all been born on this earth as part of one great human family, and from the very beginning our entire existence has been linked with human love and affection. Birth occurs because of the attraction between a man and a woman. When that passion is refined and made selfless it becomes compassion, such as exists between a mother and her child. From a Buddhist perspective, at one time or another all beings have been our mothers. By reflecting in this way, our selfish and aggressive tendencies will naturally subside, giving birth to our intrinsic Buddha&#x2013;Nature.<br> <br>Buddha in Sanskrit means "to be awake," "to be fully conscious." Since beginningless time our intrinsic Buddha&#x2013;nature has been obscured by the forces of ignorance, greed, and aggression, as symbolized by the pig, the rooster, and the snake depicted in the center of Tibetan paintings of the Wheel of Life. These negative forces of the mind obscure our limitless inborn potential and are the root cause of our frustrating transmigrations through cyclic existence. By cultivating basic love and kindness, however, we can overcome these inner afflictions and develop happiness and peace not only within ourselves but also among other beings.<br> <br>The Buddha likened consciousness to an ox cart carving deep grooves in the monsoon mud. By the time of the dry season, or another life, when the same ox cart (or consciousness) comes around again on its accustomed track, its wheels will naturally slip into the ruts it created the previous summer, only this time the ruts have become deeper and more entrenched. Our challenge in each lifetime is to abandon these ruts of narrow&#x2013;minded habit and, with insight and compassion, forge a new path that leaves no karmic trail. Through developing this innate potential, the wheel of Samsara, or suffering, becomes the wheel of Nirvana, or enlightenment.<br> <br>But I feel that if day to day you lead a good life, honestly, with love, with compassion, with selflessness, then it will automatically contribute to the attainment of Nirvana. Like the lotus which thrives in mud, the potential for realization grows in the rich soil of our everyday lives. Abstract concepts that are not grounded in this earth, in our own human experience, can never bear fruit.<br> <br>For more than twelve hundred years the highest ideals of Tibetan civilization have been to emulate the awakened qualities of the Buddha and to strive in freeing all beings from suffering and cyclic existence. To achieve this goal the Tibetan people have evolved a unique and complex culture both earthy and sublime. Although we may not have advanced far technologically, in terms of the development of the mind we are quite rich.<br> <br>Tibetans are not a politically large and powerful people; we have no great material assets. But our internal resources, found in our way of life, our culture, and our spiritual traditions, have helped us, even in the face of great hardship and suffering, to follow the path of peace and to find comfort in the pursuit of love and compassion. As surely as we are born we will die. But how we choose to live our lives, what seeds of karma we sow through our actions and our thoughts, will determine our state of mind at the moment of death and in the life that follows. If we have lived our lives developing basic human kindness we can be at peace with those around us, and external problems will not trouble us overmuch. Then even death, like birth itself, can be welcomed as a rare and precious opportunity to grow beyond our current limitations.<br> <br>Iconographically, the wheel of life portrays the tendencies and diverse possibilities within samsaric existence. Just as meditating on the wheel of life can help the viewer to see his or her own life with greater clarity, reflecting on the diverse qualities of different cultures can help us to view our own societies from a larger perspective. The present volume introduces Tibetan culture as a journey from life until death&#x2014;addressing themes that as human beings we all share in common. This book does not present the Tibetan way of life as something to be either embraced or rejected, but offers a way of understanding the Tibetans better as a people. Looking at the world as others see it and sharing in their thoughts and reflections is itself an act of compassion. Through compassion we develop greater empathy and appreciation for the other beings with whom we share life on this small planet.<br> <br>By sharing our differing beliefs and unique insights we can enrich each other: not by emulating each others way of life, but by opening ourselves to other points of view. Within the fascinating range of human cultures and languages, individual likes and dislikes, our basic nature is essentially the same. In our diverse ways we all share the same dreams of achieving happiness and overcoming suffering. It's my sincere hope that the images and voices of the Tibetan people contained in this book may help to spark interest in the Tibetan way of life and the ideals to which it aspires.<br> <br>His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet<br> <br>January 29, 1993<br></p><h2>A Visual Catechism of the Orthodox Church</h2><p>&#34;A Visual Catechism&#34; is a book written in an original way, which offers essential information to young children and those wishing to come to the Orthodox Church and be baptised. In a simple and concise manner it communicates the basic truths of our faith and what the Orthodox Church is. The first part of the book contains iconographic illustrations with short titles which make clear the central meaning of the picture. In the second part there are brief explanations which analyse and interpret the illustration in more detail. Thus the book provides a visual catechism and makes us aware of Orthodox teachings. Reference is made to the creation of the world, the fall of man, the Incarnation of the Word, and Christ&#39;s life and work. We learn about the Triune God, the Church, the Orthodox Clergy, the Holy Temple, the resurrection of the dead and eternal life. It is not sufficient for an Orthodox Christian to have been baptised at some point: he must live the sacramental life of the Church, pray to God and be aware that the Orthodox Church is a family and a hospital which cures man in order to lead him to communion and union with God. This book is an indispensable and easy-to-use aid for teachers and Catechists, but also for any faithful member of the Church, because it can help to consolidate what he knows, in a clear and concise way.</p><p></p><h2>Yoga at the Wall: Like Stanzas in a Poem</h2><p>Yoga at the Wall by Nancy McCaochan Paperback, 160 pages.

Beautiful photography and texts educate on natural plant species, their usage, meaning, location, and history.<br></p><p>Unlike architecture, sculpture or painting, the art of gardening produces living works that grow, blossom, change, and fade. As such, the garden could be considered the supreme work of art, and indeed it has been so in all civilizations. A garden on any scale enhances the architecture it surrounds. What would Versailles have been without its spectacular gardens and their orderly vistas, or the great country houses in England without the eighteenth-century landscape designers? Likewise it is hard to imagine rural or urban houses in Colombia without their planned patios and courtyards.<br><br>The jagged geography of Colombia divides it into several contrasting regions: the Caribbean coast, Antioquia, Santander, Cundinamarca and Boyac�, the Cauca valley, and the plains of the <i>Llanos</i>, to mention a few. The climates and flora of these areas are markedly different, but their inhabitants share in common love for plants and a keen interest in gardening. Long before there were professional gardeners and landscape designers, all Colombians, from the wealthy <i>hacendados</i> to the modest <i>campesinos</i>, devised and planted their own gardens, according to personal taste and economic limitations.<br><br>A delightful eclecticism is captured in these pages in hundreds of photographs of every type of garden from extravagant parks to minute flowered niches. Experimentation is commonplace; each journey and Sunday excursion brings home additional plants. With the added factor of unpredictable rainfalls and prolonged droughts, most Colombian gardens are aesthetic and horticultural laboratories.<br><br>In the course of compiling the photographic material for this book, it proved impossible to include all gardens worthy of presentation, nor could all the gardens featured here be photographed at the peak of their splendor. Nevertheless, the attentive reader will be able to enjoy an impressive range of plants, color, composition and integration of cultivation with the natural landscape, which, in the absence of a great classical tradition, make up the particular charm of the Colombian garden.<br>Benjam�n Villegas is an architect and graphic designer.

Reprint.</p><p>Sharyn McCrumb says &#34;Joan Hess is the patron saint of comic mystery,&#34; and that endorsement by a fine writer of mostly non-comic mysteries should be good enough for anyone who likes a chuckle with their chills. For the uninitiated, Maggody is the small Arkansas town where Arly Hanks rules as police chief and where trouble usually begins with an M--as in the previous adventures as Madness in Maggody, Malice in Maggody, Martians in Maggody, Mischief in Maggody, and Much Ado in Maggody. (Well, it does make the books easy to identify.) In this latest, just out in paperback, Hess brings greedy televangelist Malachi Hope to town, and all hell breaks loose.You'd think by now, with the ninth appearance of sharp-witted, sharp-tongued Police Chief Arly Hanks, the shysters and quacks of this world would know to steer clear of Maggody, Ark., pop. 755. But handsome, slick televangelist Malachi Hope has his eyes set on developing a Christian theme park on the outskirts of town; and his silken promises of miracle cures, prosperity and fame for the region draw crowds of contributing believers to his nightly laser-lit revival meetings. While most of the locals see their own dreams depicted in the Reverend's vision of Maggody's future, skeptical Arly, who spent some time in Manhattan, doesn't trust Hope, nor his entourage, including his glamourous wife and her sullen teenage sister. The girls' basketball coach is found dead in the high-school gym, a murder quickly followed by another. To track the killer, Arly goes behind the scenes of Hope's organization and into the equally daunting world of local teendom. From Brother Verber, scoping out the threat to his congregation in disguise, to the massive and newly pregnant Dahlia Buchanon, who resumes her junk-food diet after Hope says Jesus has cured her diabetes, the citizens of Maggody continue to deliver guaranteed laugh-out-loud entertainment. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Racing cars and record breakers, 1898-1921, (Cars of the world in colour)</h2><p>ILLUSTRATED IN COLOR-WRITTEN BY T.R NICHOLSON</p><p></p><h2>The Secret (Thorndike Press Large Print Romance Series)</h2><p>Judith Hampton, a poor woman living in England, travels from her bleak home to meet the father she has never known and finds love and a world of dark secrets.

She lives near Kansas City.Ever since they met as children at the annual summer festival on the border of their two countries, Judith Hampton of England has been fast friends with Frances Catherine Kirkaldy of Scotland. Despite the enmity between the two lands in this period (the late 12th century), Judith is determined to attend the birth of Frances Catherine's first child and find her father, a Scottish laird she has never seen (when they finally meet, it is not in the fashion she had anticipated). En route to her friend's Highland home, Judith charms her escort, Frances Catherine's brother-in-law Iain Maitland. So she is baffled when Iain withdraws into his role of clan laird. Equally confusing is Frances Catherine's claim that after years with the Maitlands, she is still an outsider. But Judith determinedly forges friendships and reexerts her charms over Iain, leading to a lively, unconventional wedding. Woven into Judith's story is an intriguing, almost heretical message for a romance novel: a woman needs more than the right man to have a full, happy life. That Garwood ( Guardian Angel ) can argue this point and still deliver a delightful tale is an accomplishment. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Original Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy</h2><p>A collection of adventures featuring the well-known red-haired dolls Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy.</p><p></p><h2>Where is Jasper Johns?: Adventures in Art</h2><p>Presents examples of the artist&#39;s work accompanied by background and interpretive material.</p><p>DEBRA PEARLMAN is an artist and educator who thaught for many years at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and is presently a teaching artist for Lincoln Center Institute.

No, it wasn&#x2019;t an old flame. It was Jesus Christ. Leslie&#x2019;s decision to become a follower of Jesus brought heated opposition from her skeptical husband.

Today they&#x2019;re both Christians--and they want you to know that there is hope if you&#x2019;re a Christian married to a nonbeliever.

She and Lee live in Orange County, California, and are the parents of two grown children.Entering into the Mismatch THE WEATHER WAS CRISP AND CLEAR ON THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS 1966 when my friend Pete and I took the train from our suburban homes into downtown Chicago. We wandered around the Loop for a while, reveling in the bustle of the city, but then came time for me to bring him on a pilgrimage that I took as often as I could. Fighting the wind, we trudged across the Michigan Avenue bridge and stopped in front of the Wrigley Building. There we stood, our hands shoved into our pockets for warmth, as we gazed across the street at the gothic majesty of Tribune Tower. I can&#39;t remember whether I muttered the word aloud or if it merely echoed in my mind: &#39;Someday.&#39; Pete was quiet. High school freshmen are entitled to their dreams. We lingered for a few minutes and watched as people flowed in and out of the newspaper office. Were they the reporters whose bylines I studied every morning? Or the editors who dispatched them around the world? Or the printers who manned the gargantuan presses? I let my imagination run wild---until Pete&#39;s patience wore thin. We turned and walked up the Magnificent Mile, browsing through the overpriced and pretentious shops, until we decided to embark on the twenty-minute walk back to the train station. As we passed in front of the Civic Opera House, though, I heard a familiar voice beckon from the crowd. &#39;Hey, Lee, what&#39;re you doing here?&#39; called Clay, another high school student who lived in my neighborhood. I didn&#39;t answer right away. I was too captivated by the girl at his side, holding his hand and wearing his gold engraved ID bracelet. Her brown hair cascaded to her shoulders; her smile was at once coy and confident. &#39;Uh, well, um . . . just hanging around,&#39; I managed to say to Clay, though my eyes were riveted on his date. By the time he introduced us to Leslie, I wasn&#39;t thinking much about Clay or Pete or the fact that my hands were getting numb from the cold and I was standing ankle-deep in soot-encrusted snow. I made sure, however, to pay close attention when Clay pronounced Leslie&#39;s name; I knew I&#39;d need the proper spelling to look it up in the phone book. After all, everything&#39;s fair in love and war. From Fairytale to Nightmare As for Leslie, I found out later that she wasn&#39;t thinking about Clay as the two of them rode the train home that afternoon. When she arrived at her house in suburban Palatine, she strolled into the kitchen and found her mother, a Scottish war bride, busily preparing dinner. &#39;Mom,&#39; she announced, &#39;today I met the boy I&#39;m going to marry!&#39; The response wasn&#39;t what she expected. Her mother barely looked up from the pot she was stirring. In a voice mixed with condescension and skepticism, she replied dismissively: &#39;That&#39;s nice, dear.&#39; But there was no doubt in Leslie&#39;s mind. Nor in mine. When I called her the next night from a pay-phone outside a gas station near my house (with four brothers and sisters, that was the only way I could get some privacy), we talked as if we had known each other for years. People like to debate whether there&#39;s such a thing as love at first sight; for us, the issue had been settled once and for all. Leslie and I dated almost continuously throughout high school, and when I went off to study journalism at the University of Missouri, she moved there so we could be close to each other. We got married when I was twenty and she was nineteen. After I graduated we moved to Chicago, where my lifelong dream of becoming a reporter at the Chicago Tribune was realized. Leslie, meanwhile, began her career at a savings and loan association across the street from my newspaper office. We lived a fairy-tale life. We enjoyed the exhilaration and challenge of climbing the corporate ladder while residing in an exciting, upscale neighborhood. Leslie became pregnant with our first child, a girl we named Alison, and then later gave birth to a son, Kyle. Buoyed by our deep love for each other, our marriage was strong and secure---until someone came between us, threatening to shipwreck our relationship and land us in divorce court. It wasn&#39;t an affair. It wasn&#39;t the resurfacing of an old flame. Instead, the someone who nearly capsized our marriage was none other than God himself. At least, that&#39;s who I blamed at the time. Ironically, it was faith in Jesus Christ---which most couples credit for contributing to the strength of their marriage---that very nearly destroyed our relationship and split us apart forever. All because of a spiritual mismatch. A Marriage Without God I can describe God&#39;s role in our courtship and early marriage in one sentence: He just wasn&#39;t on our radar screen. In other words, he was irrelevant. Personally, I considered myself an atheist. I had rejected the idea of God after being taught in high school that Darwin&#39;s theory pleasure. As for Christians, I tended to dismiss them as naive and uncritical thinkers who needed a crutch of an imaginary deity to get them through life. Leslie, on the other hand, would probably have considered herself an agnostic. While I tended to react with antagonism toward people of faith, she was more in spiritual neutral. She had little church influence growing up, although she has fond child-hood memories of her mother gently singing traditional hymns to her while she tucked her in at night. For Leslie, God was merely an abstract idea that she had never taken the time to explore. Without God in my life, I lacked a moral compass. My character slowly became corroded by my success-at-any-cost mentality. My anger would flash because of my free-floating frustration at not being able to find the fulfillment I craved. My drinking binges got out of control a little too often, and I worked much too hard at my job, in effect making my career into my god.</p><h2>The Man From the Desert</h2><p>If Hal Hanaway can stop Ben Kittrick from robbing his own family, Ben&#39;s uncle will deed his ranch to Hanaway, but the task proves difficult when a trigger-happy sheriff jumps into the action</p><p></p><h2>Mastering the Art of Longarm Quilting: 40 Original Designs - Step-by-Step Instructions - Takes You from Novice to Expert</h2><p><p>This essential guide to using a longarm machine includes easy-to-follow instructions to get you well on the way to mastery!

Can you get over here and meet with Bill Moyers [a Special Assistant to the President] and me at eleven o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;1<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We want to talk to you about joining the White House staff.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moyers and Bundy were waiting in Moyers&#x2019;s office. They said the President (whose only previous contact with me was a handshake in August 1964)2 wanted me to take on two tasks: administration headhunter and White House expert on Latin American affairs. Moyers said my experience with McNamara gave me good lines to top talent, and Bundy thought work I had done on Cuba, Panama, and the Dominican Republic gave me a grounding in Latin America. I told them I would have to talk to McNamara. They urged me to wait until the President had spoken to him. I said I couldn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>As soon as I returned to the Pentagon, I joined McNamara at lunch.3 His response was almost brusque. &#x201c;Out of the question. First, they should never have talked to you without talking to me. Second, the work you&#x2019;re doing here is far more important. There are only two jobs over there that would be more important: Bundy&#x2019;s and Moyers&#x2019;s. Moyers&#x2019;s job only if the President made it a domestic adviser, in charge of the legislative program, coordinating economic policy and domestic matters generally. Forget about it. I&#x2019;ll talk to the President.&#x201d;<br> <br>Less than a week later, returning from a meeting at the LBJ Ranch in Texas,4 McNamara told me I would not be going to the White House. &#x201c;At least for now,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;But I fear we&#x2019;ve whetted the President&#x2019;s appetite. So you may just have a six-month reprieve.&#x201d;<br> <br>The second call came eight months later, on July 8, 1965, from Jack Valenti, another of the President&#x2019;s special assistants. &#x201c;The President wants you on his staff,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;George Reedy [the presidential press secretary] is resigning today. Moyers is replacing him. The President wants you to pick up his old job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to talk to McNamara,&#x201d; I responded, excited but nervous and unsure about my boss&#x2019;s reaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;The President already has,&#x201d; Valenti chortled. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t make the same mistake twice. Get on over here.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the White House Moyers and Valenti said that my new job would be to prepare legislative programs, manage domestic crises, and act as a general-utility infielder on the domestic scene.<br> <br>When I got back to the Pentagon, McNamara told me to come right to his office.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s also important that you work on matters relating to the economy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The economic problems are bound to be severe as Great Society programs need more and more funds, since the cost of the war in Vietnam is likely to rise.&#x201d;<br> <br>An hour later, McNamara called me in to tell me that he had convinced the President he should let me coordinate economic policy.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a job!&#x201d; I gasped.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a job. With this President, it&#x2019;s not even a job description. It&#x2019;s an opportunity. You&#x2019;ll have to prove yourself to him to turn it into a job,&#x201d; McNamara said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take it. He needs someone to pull the domestic side together. It won&#x2019;t be easy. I assure you of this: you will never work for a more complicated man as long as you live. But you&#x2019;re also not likely to work for a more intelligent one. Anyway, you&#x2019;ve been in the Defense Department four years. The change will be good for you. No one should stay in a job for more than four or five years.&#x201d;<br> <br>Late that afternoon, Moyers called to say the President wanted me at the White House mess for dinner. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s having a small dinner for the chairmen of the 1964 Great Society task forces and he wants you to have an opportunity to meet them.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said I was planning to have dinner with a friend from Panama who was already on his way to the restaurant. I thought I&#x2019;d best skip the White House dinner. Moyers understood.<br> <br>Five minutes later, he called again. &#x201c;The President told me to send a car out for your friend and take him home and for you to come here, period.&#x201d;<br> <br>So went my first lesson: this President did not like people to say no to him.<br> <br>At dinner,5 Johnson listened intently as each academic spent a few minutes outlining the most serious problems and opportunities facing America and the President. Remarkably, at least in retrospect, the Vietnam War was scarcely mentioned. Everyone was confident we could solve our domestic problems. In only nineteen months after assuming the presidency, Johnson had made enormous progress on the Democratic party&#x2019;s progressive agenda.<br> <br>The President, with whom I had not yet spoken, introduced me as a member of his staff. On my way out, he said he expected to see me at the LBJ Ranch for the weekend. As I drove home, I thought about my only direct experience of Lyndon Johnson in action.<br> <br>On October 14, 1964, it was reported that Walter Jenkins, a long-time Johnson aide (as close to a White House chief-of-staff as the President ever tolerated), had been arrested a week earlier for making advances to a sixty-one-year-old man at the downtown Washington YMCA. The story broke less than three weeks before the presidential election and promised to fuel Goldwater&#x2019;s charges of corruption and improprieties in Johnson&#x2019;s past.<br> <br>Around seven that evening, McNamara called me into his office. &#x201c;Walter Jenkins was a member of an Air Force Reserve unit on Capitol Hill,&#x201d; he said, speaking sharply. &#x201c;The President wants a copy of his Reserve personnel file immediately. Get it. Make damn sure that everything is Xeroxed and nothing is removed. Have one of your guys do the Xeroxing himself or watch it being done.&#x201d;<br> <br>I called Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Lieutenant General William Stone. &#x201c;The Secretary of Defense wants a complete copy of Walter Jenkins&#x2019;s Air Force Reserve personnel record,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;This is so sensitive I&#x2019;m asking you to Xerox it yourself. One of my staff will come down immediately to help you. After it&#x2019;s copied, I suggest you keep the original in a safe in your own office.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two military officers on my staff were still around, Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haig and an Air Force lieutenant colonel. Rather than put a young Air Force officer in the impossible position of standing over a general in his own service, I sent Al Haig to monitor the Xeroxing.<br> <br>As soon as we had a copy, McNamara and I rushed to Moyers&#x2019;s White House office. As Bundy, McNamara, and I gathered around a speaker phone, Moyers called Valenti at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, where the President was speaking to the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner. Lady Bird Johnson was preparing a sympathetic statement supporting Walter Jenkins and his family.6 When the President got on the phone, he expressed his suspicion that Jenkins had been framed or set up by the Republicans. He asked McNamara to read him texts of Jenkins&#x2019;s Air Force Reserve fitness reports signed by the commanding officer of the Capitol Hill Air Force Reserve unit. One was more glowing than the next.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said the President, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better call Walter&#x2019;s commanding officer. He&#x2019;ll be shaken by what&#x2019;s happened to Walter. And, in any case, I know he wouldn&#x2019;t want to embarrass himself by making any damned-fool statements.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moyers and Bundy smiled. McNamara and I exchanged glances. The commanding officer who had signed Jenkins&#x2019;s glowing reports was Air Force Reserve Major General Barry Goldwater.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I got up at 3 A.M. on Saturday, July 10, 1965, to shower, pack, dress, and drive to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to catch a presidential Lear Jet. Valenti, his wife Mary Margaret, and speechwriter Richard Goodwin were also on board. We arrived at the ranch just after 9 A.M. Johnson met us at the airplane and sent us off to our rooms. Then Mrs. Johnson offered us scrambled eggs and spicy deer sausage. When I demurred, she said, &#x201c;I suggest you eat something now, young fellow. You never know with Lyndon what time the next meal will be.&#x201d; After breakfast we changed into bathing suits and joined the President at the pool, where he was swimming. His secretary, Victoria (Vicky) McCammon, sat on the side with her feet in the water.<br> <br>The pool, directly southeast of the ranch house, was surrounded by a red-brick border, a concrete sidewalk, and Bermuda grass. The President was still in the water when I dove in. He was talking about the Senate&#x2019;s passage of the bill to create Medicare the day before. From the shallow end of the pool he shouted to me, &#x201c;Are you ready to come help your President?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be an honor and a privilege,&#x201d; I called back.<br> <br>In the early afternoon, the President, with me next to him in the front seat, took his white Lincoln convertible, top down, for a drive around the ranch. Johnson had changed to dry trunks and a clean shirt, but I was still in my one pair of wet trunks and a knit shirt.<br> <br>It was incredibly hot; the dust clouds made it hard to breathe. But there was relief. As we drove around, we were followed by a car and a station wagon with Secret Service agents. The President drank Cutty Sark scotch and soda out of a large white plastic foam cup; I had a Coca-Cola. Periodically, Johnson would slow down, sometimes stop for a moment, and hold his left arm outside the car, shaking the cup and ice. A Secret Service agent would run up to the car, take the cup and go back to the station wagon. There another agent would refill it with ice, scotch, and soda as the first agent trotted behind the wagon. Then the first agent would run the refilled cup up to LBJ&#x2019;s outstretched arm and waiting hand, as the President&#x2019;s car moved slowly along.<br> <br>As he drove, the President would call his ranch foreman, Dale Malechek, on the car&#x2019;s Motorola radiophone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dale, the Hereford in East Barley Field, I think it&#x2019;s number 481 [many Herefords were numbered on a horn], get on over and look at him. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to be eating properly and looks a little underweight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dale, on the feeding tree in the Fish Tank, get some more salt for the deer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dale. This Goddamn fence at Dales Trap needs to be fixed. Get it done in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>As we passed from one section of the ranch to another, Secret Servicemen would jump out of the car in front and rush to open gates so we could drive through without stopping.<br> <br>We stopped at LBJ&#x2019;s birthplace, a small two-room building with a tiny barn behind, drove back for a fast ride on the airstrip and again around the ranch, ending at the ranch house around 2 P.M. Shortly afterward, we boarded a helicopter for the Haywood Ranch, another of Johnson&#x2019;s properties, and Coca-Cola Cove at Lake LBJ, part of a chain of artificial lakes set in central Texas, thanks to the persistence of Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson. We lunched and spent the afternoon and early evening on a thirty-seven-foot yacht. From lake-front properties and in small motorboats, wire-service photographers constantly sought to take pictures. Secret Service agents in black speedboats tried to keep the photographers away. Johnson took care to drink out of an opaque plastic cup, usually below deck, whether it was filled with scotch or Fresca.<br> <br>We went ashore briefly at a house on the lake that the President called &#x201c;Jack and Mary Margaret&#x2019;s,&#x201d; after the Valentis. As we walked through the house, the President stopped in a bright shaft of sunlight in the living room. He unbuckled his belt and twisted toward his right side as he lowered his pants and pushed down his undershorts, trying to look at his increasingly bare right buttock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something hurts back there,&#x201d; he said, now exploring the surface with his right hand. &#x201c;Is that a boil?&#x201d; he asked me as I stood to his right. Astonished, I looked&#x2014;&#x201c;peeked&#x201d; would be a better word&#x2014;and gulped, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to get Dr. [presidential physician George] Burkley to look at it,&#x201d; the President said matter-of-factly as he tucked in his shirt, pulled up his pants, and buckled his belt.<br> <br>In the late afternoon, the President took me waterskiing. He drove his twenty-foot gold-colored speedboat up and down the lake and under a bridge with concrete supports about every ten yards. He drove faster and faster, zigging and zagging around the lake and between the concrete pillars. The faster he drove and twisted, the more I was determined to stay up. He threw me once. He was going so fast that I thought I&#x2019;d split apart when I flew off the skis and hit the water. Determined to prove myself, I got back up and managed not to fall off again.<br> <br>We returned to shore around 8 P.M. The President, with Vicky McCammon in the seat alongside him and me in the back, was now driving around in a small blue car with the top down. We reached a steep incline at the edge of the lake and the car started rolling rapidly toward the water. The President shouted, &#x201c;The brakes don&#x2019;t work! The brakes won&#x2019;t hold! We&#x2019;re going in! We&#x2019;re going under!&#x201d;<br> <br>The car splashed into the water. I started to get out. Just then the car leveled and I realized we were in an Amphicar. The President laughed. As we putted along the lake then (and throughout that evening), he teased me. &#x201c;Vicky, did you see what Joe did? He didn&#x2019;t give a damn about his President. He just wanted to save his own skin and get out of the car.&#x201d; Then he&#x2019;d roar.<br> <br>Around 9 P.M. we went to the Haywood ranch house for dinner. I was still in my wet bathing suit. The others, more experienced in LBJ&#x2019;s ways, had brought along a change of clothing. Near midnight we returned by chopper to the main ranch house, and the President asked me to come to his office. For half an hour, he handed me one paper after another, directing me to give them, along with his instructions, to various White House aides or cabinet members. When he finally retired, White House aide Jake Jacobsen gently took the papers from me and said he would carry out the President&#x2019;s instructions. I went to bed, almost twenty-four hours after I&#x2019;d gotten up in Washington.<br> <br>Life at the ranch would always be unpredictable. We never knew when we would work or play. In the pool, on the boat, during a meal, the President might give us an order to do something or to get an agency or department head to take some action. Breakfast was always early and on our own, but lunch could be anywhere from one to four o&#x2019;clock; it might be at the LBJ Ranch, on the boat, or at one of the Johnsons&#x2019; other ranches. The President usually took a nap, which could last anywhere from thirty minutes to a couple of hours. Dinner might be at eight or midnight and its location was just as uncertain. On Sundays we had no idea whether we would return that evening or Monday morning, afternoon, or evening, and we often departed on less than an hour&#x2019;s notice. Mrs. Johnson displayed ceaseless patience in accommodating her husband&#x2019;s spur-of-the-moment style.<br> <br>That first Sunday, Johnson and I attended separate services, he at the First Christian Church in Johnson City and I at St. Mary&#x2019;s Catholic Church in Fredericks...</p><h2>In Vogue: Sixty years of celebrities and fashion from British Vogue</h2><p>A wonderful expose of fashion through the years.

Although a part of history largely ignored in favor of World War II, the Spanish civil war was a testing ground for German, Italian, and Russian political and territorial ambitions, as well as a passionate cause for idealists, Communists, and anti-Fascists. Neugass records his observations with prescience and an eye to posterity. After returning from Spain, he sought to have his journal published but failed to do so before his untimely death in 1949. The typescript, only recently found, has been edited and annotated by two board members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade comrades and add notes that put his remarks in context. Although Neugass served for only about five months in 1937&#x2013;38, he saw the fall of the Spanish Republic to the better-equipped Fascist forces under General Franco. This valuable addition to Spanish civil war history also wartime emotions&#x2014;the boredom, excitement, fear, pain, and loss. Published in time for the 70th anniversary of the Great Retreats of the Republican forces, this work is highly recommended for academic libraries and libraries with Spanish civil war collections.

All of his novels are <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including his stand-alone debut novel, <i>Term Limits</i>.

American Assassin </i>was released as a major film in 2017.Enemy of the State <br>CHAPTER 1<br> <br>Above al-Shirqat<br> <br>Iraq<br> <br>MITCH Rapp tried to find a more comfortable position, but none was available. His helmet was jammed against the top of the fuselage and there was something sharp poking through the mesh seat just to the right of his spine.<br> <br>Not exactly the CIA&#x2019;s G550, but then this aircraft hadn&#x2019;t exactly been designed to ferry government VIPs. Its only purpose was the insertion of select teams behind enemy lines, and in order to do that effectively it had to be small, fast, and stealthy. There was no pilot or cockpit, no cabin pressure or heat, and no light other than the dim glow from a computer screen to his right.<br> <br>He glanced over and scanned the data it contained. Four hundred knots at 25,000 feet on a south-by-southeast heading. An infrared map moved lazily beneath the compass and numbers, tracking the ground. Near the bottom of the display, his target began to appear.<br> <br>Al-Shirqat.<br> <br>Despite everything he&#x2019;d lived through&#x2014;everything he&#x2019;d done&#x2014;there were very few places that held memories bad enough to make his palms sweat. In fact, only two. The place his wife had died and �al-Shirqat.<br> <br>A green light over the door flashed and he disconnected his mask from the aircraft&#x2019;s oxygen supply, immediately reattaching it to a low-volume tank on his wingsuit. Slipping out of his chair, he sat on the carbon fiber floor and lashed a small pack between his legs. The countdown had started and he waited until the door began to retract to lower his goggles. The outside air temperature was thirty below zero and it lashed at him as he fought his way to the inky black opening. When the countdown in his earpiece reached zero, he threw himself out, struggling to maintain a stable position as he accelerated into his free fall.<br> <br>After a few seconds he was steady enough to glance at the screen strapped to his wrist. Along with altitude, it indicated direction and horizontal distance to his drop zone. Not that hitting it exactly was all that critical&#x2014;it was a more or less randomly chosen spot about a mile from the edge of the ISIS-controlled city. His old mentor Stan Hurley had beaten precision into him during jump training, though. Rapp could still picture the man standing in the middle of the landing circle, staring skyward.<br> <br>If you don&#x2019;t kick me in my head, I&#x2019;m going to kick the shit out of yours.<br> <br>Who would have thought he&#x2019;d miss the old cuss so much?<br> <br>Everything below him was dark, creating a disorienting sensation of floating in space. Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s former officers were becoming increasingly prominent in ISIS leadership and with their rise came a commensurate improvement in discipline. They&#x2019;d completely blacked out al-Shirqat in an effort to reduce the effectiveness of U.S. bombing runs. Worse, a few mobile SAM units were being moved around the battered streets. Their functionality was unknown, but the knowledge that they were there was enough to prompt him to jump from altitude and come in sideways.<br> <br>He pulled his chute about a thousand feet above the ground, releasing the pack between his legs and letting it drop onto the lanyard connected to him. With a few deft pulls on the chute&#x2019;s toggles, he came down directly on top of the planned target&#x2014;a sandy knoll that offered him the high ground.<br> <br>Rapp gathered the chute quickly and pulled off his goggles and helmet. He lay still for almost two minutes, listening. When he was satisfied that his arrival had gone unnoticed, he stripped down to a grimy pair of jeans and T-shirt, then dragged his pack to him.<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t contain much more than a shoulder holster with a Glock and silencer, two extra mags, some dried meat, and a shovel to bury everything else. Once done, there was little that would identify him as anything more than a local Iraqi who had been caught in the desert after sunset.<br> <br>Without the screen on his wrist, he was forced to use the stars for navigation. Fortunately, they were just as effective now as they had been when explorers first set out to discover the world. He followed a southerly course, rubbing at his face to remove any marks left by his goggles. Based on weeks of overhead surveillance, he didn&#x2019;t expect to run into any security forces as he entered the city, but there was nothing certain in this business.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>When Rapp reached the bombed-out buildings at the edge of town, he dropped to his stomach again. The men he was there for were farther toward the interior and he mentally reviewed the path through the city laid out by the Agency&#x2019;s cartographers.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;d escaped al-Shirqat last time, he&#x2019;d been posing as an American ISIS recruit. The former Iraqi general controlling the area had devised a plan to use dirty bombs to take out Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s oil-producing capacity, destabilizing the world economy and leaving the Saudis vulnerable to a takeover by Islamic radicals. Rapp had managed to stop the plot, but not without the help of the local resistance.<br> <br>Now the identities of those men had been discovered and ISIS was closing in on them. Most of the people at Langley thought he was crazy to come back, arguing that the risks far outweighed the rewards. And they were probably right. With one exception, the five young men Rapp was there to extract weren&#x2019;t good fighters. None were much use at gathering intelligence, either. Mostly they sat around making long political speeches that the others then heartily agreed with. But when he&#x2019;d needed them, they&#x2019;d stepped up. Fuck if he wouldn&#x2019;t do the same.<br> <br>Unfortunately, that decision had forced him to put a reluctant Joe Maslick in charge of the Rabat, Morocco, operation. In the end, it was probably a good thing. The op wasn&#x2019;t all that complicated and Maslick needed some command experience whether he liked it or not.<br> <br>Rapp closed his eyes for a moment, acknowledging that he was just stalling. He&#x2019;d hoped never to have to return to this place, going so far as to try to convince the military to mount a major assault to take back the city. Predictably, they&#x2019;d pushed back. It wasn&#x2019;t that they didn&#x2019;t think they could do it. With U.S. support, the Iraqi army was strong enough now to recapture it. The problem was that the locals didn&#x2019;t �really see the Iraqi army as much different than ISIS. Just another occupying force to fight an endless guerrilla war against. Welcome to the Middle East.<br> <br>Rapp stood and moved forward, slipping between two buildings and navigating by the light of a full moon. This area of town had taken a lot of battle damage and was largely uninhabited now. He&#x2019;d been through it once before but hadn&#x2019;t bothered to commit it to memory.<br> <br>After about five minutes of generally southern travel, he came to a collapsed building with little more than the east wall surviving. It was one of the landmarks he&#x2019;d identified from a photo at Langley and he turned left, cutting diagonally across a cratered square.<br> <br>By the time he made it to the far side, he was certain he was being tracked. There was a natural rhythm to the debris dislodging from the structures around him and now it was off just enough to stand out. The footfalls were random and careful, but to the practiced ear they were unmistakable.<br> <br>He kept his pace casual, climbing over a burned car to gain access to the alley behind it. When he was certain he was obscured from view, he sidestepped into a gap in the wall to his right.<br> <br>Whoever was behind him was disciplined&#x2014;Rapp would give him that. It was a full two minutes before he was able to pick out an intermittent shadow inching toward his position. He dug a shard of concrete from around a piece of rebar and threw it, creating a nearly inaudible clatter twenty yards to the south.<br> <br>The footsteps faltered for a moment. Rapp retrieved his Glock and waited, barely breathing. A few seconds passed before the silhouette reappeared. The man it belonged to was an inch taller than him and a good six inches wider at the shoulder. He had an assault rifle strapped across his chest and was moving in a manner that suggested he was more than just another ISIS dipshit.<br> <br>Rapp remained motionless in the darkness where he&#x2019;d taken refuge, watching the man approach. When he walked past, Rapp stepped out and pressed his gun to the back of his head.<br> <br>The man didn&#x2019;t cry out or even speak, instead coming to a halt and raising his hands. Rapp moved slowly around him, brushing the barrel of his Glock through the man&#x2019;s hair until it came to rest against his forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember you being less sloppy,&#x201d; Rapp said in Arabic.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I remember you looking like the wrong end of a goat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp pulled the gun back and the big man embraced him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold your face to the sky, my friend. Let me see you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp raised his chin to catch the moonlight and the Iraqi gripped Rapp&#x2019;s beard, moving his face around to see better.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s miraculous what you Americans can do,&#x201d; he said sincerely.<br> <br>In order to not be recognized on his prior operation in al-Shirqat, Rapp had been forced to let Joe Maslick beat his face into something resembling raw meat. That was the only face Gaffar had ever seen&#x2014;the broken, bleeding, and swollen one Maslick had created.<br> <br>&#x201c;More surgeries than I care to remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but still . . . it&#x2019;s incredible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How are the others?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re managing, but they aren&#x2019;t soldiers. Fear is a good motivator, but this . . .&#x201d; He waved a hand around him. &#x201c;The cold, the boredom, the lack of food. It is hard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long have you been hiding out here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp nodded. Often it wasn&#x2019;t the terror and exhaustion of combat that beat people down. It was everything in between.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; Gaffar said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to them.&#x201d;<br> <br>What was left of this part of town appeared to be uninhabited and of no interest to ISIS forces, but still it made sense to proceed carefully. They finally arrived at a massive concrete slab that had tipped against a crumbling wall. Gaffar picked up a rock and tapped it three times against what had once been a lamppost. A moment later the people Rapp had come for appeared at the entrance of the artificial cave.<br> <br>On the left were two thin men who looked like computer geeks. One seemed to have lost his glasses and was squinting uselessly into the darkness. Mohammed, their leader, didn&#x2019;t seem too much worse for the wear and neither did his brother.<br> <br>The Iraqi siblings were the only two men in the world that Rapp had a hard time looking in the eye, so he adjusted his gaze to the woman pressed against Mohammed&#x2019;s side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got married?&#x201d; Rapp said. &#x201c;Interesting sense of timing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shada was being auctioned off by ISIS. I&#x2019;ve known her since we were children. I sold everything I had and used the money to buy her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp looked into her dark eyes, taking in the unlined face and black, tangled hair. He had purchased Mohammed&#x2019;s sister under similar circumstances. This girl was younger and more fearful, but otherwise no different than Laleh had been.<br> <br>The memory was accompanied by a painful constriction in Rapp&#x2019;s chest and he pushed her image from his mind. It would come back, though. It always did.<br> <br>&#x201c;If there isn&#x2019;t room for me, I&#x2019;ll stay behind,&#x201d; she said as the silence drew out.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; one of the geeks said, a little too loudly. &#x201c;If anyone is going to stay here, it should be him. He got us into this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; Gaffar said in a harsh whisper. &#x201c;We got ourselves into this. It&#x2019;s our country to fight for. Our people who have destroyed it. Not his.&#x201d;<br> <br>He raised his hand to strike the man, but Rapp caught it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, all you have to do is hold it together for a little longer. Then this&#x2019;ll all be over.&#x201d;<br> <br>He retrieved the food he&#x2019;d brought and divided it among them. &#x201c;Now eat up and gather your gear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then she can come?&#x201d; Mohammed said.<br> <br>Rapp nodded. &#x201c;Five minutes.&#x201d;</p><h2>Jesus on Leadership: Leader&#39;s Workbook</h2><p>Seven principles to assist leaders with everything from humbling their hearts to building a team for Christ.</p><p>I have known Gene Wilkes since he was eighteen.

Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.</p></p><p>Kenneth L.

Also on the march against the Sioux and Cheyenne was General George Crook's Wyoming Column. With Crook was Dr. Valentine T. McGillycuddy, who kept this diary in the field.In rain and blistering heat, McGillycuddy recorded many interesting details of campaigning on the frontier. At the Battle of Slim Buttes and on Crook's famous Starvation March, the doctor recorded the suffering and the humor he saw around him.On an expedition in the Black Hills the following year, McGillycuddy's wife, Fanny, accompanying her husband, assumed the duty of continuing this diary.

In <i>Border as Method</i>, Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilson chart this proliferation, investigating its implications for migratory movements, capitalist transformations, and political life. They explore the atmospheric violence that surrounds borderlands and border struggles across various geographical scales, illustrating their theoretical arguments with illuminating case studies drawn from Europe, Asia, the Pacific, the Americas, and elsewhere. Mezzadra and Neilson approach the border not only as a research object but also as an epistemic framework. Their use of the border as method enables new perspectives on the crisis and transformations of the nation-state, as well as powerful reassessments of political concepts such as citizenship and sovereignty.</p><p>Sandro Mezzadra is Associate Professor of Political Theory at the University of Bologna. Brett Neilson is Professor of Culture and Society at Western Sydney University."Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilson illustrate the fecundity of the unity of opposites. Arriving from two extremities of the global world, using the border as a 'method,' they analyze how the antithetical patterns of 'border crossing' and 'border reinforcement' generate 'border struggles,' hence subjectivities, intelligibilities, commonalities. The threshold to justice is shifted, as are the articulations of violence and language that build a new humankind. The book asks not who we are, but who we become."&#x2014;<b>�tienne Balibar</b>, author of <i>Equaliberty: Political Essays</i><br><br>"Their sights set on global movements of labor&#x2014;skilled or unskilled, legal or illegal&#x2014;Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilson mount the most ambitious attempt yet to leverage the idea of the border into a major theoretical tool for the study of global capital. They add a rich and powerful voice to contemporary debates on globalization."&#x2014;<b>Dipesh Chakrabarty</b>, author of <i>Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference</i><br><br>"This is an agenda-setting book that brings together issues of migration, labor, sovereignty, and the common into a coherent and powerful theoretical and political vision. By treating the border not as a site but as a method, Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilson demonstrate both that borders are not isolated at the margins of social space but instead run through it, and that borders have become the privileged lens through which to view contemporary politics."&#x2014;<b>Michael Hardt</b>, coauthor of the books <i>Declaration, Commonwealth</i>, <i>Multitude</i>, and <i>Empire</i><br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Against liberalism&#x2019;s duplicitous dream of a universal political language, <i>Border as Method </i>explodes on the scene voraciously combining, re-inventing, pulling apart, putting together, layering, sifting and dissecting contemporary theories and knowledge of what our capitalist world is becoming and how we might change it.&#x201d;&nbsp; (Rogier van Reekum <i>Krisis</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a rich, conceptually rewarding work. It will be required reading for those making sense of the modern redefinition of borders, the forms of subjectivity that they create, and the diverse, innovative ways in which that subjectivity is resisted and redefined.

Lovereading</p><h2>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service (James Bond)</h2><p>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service is the tenth novel in Ian Fleming&#39;s James Bond series, first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 1 April 1963. The initial and secondary print runs sold out, with over 60,000 books sold in the first month. Fleming wrote the book in Jamaica whilst the first film in the Eon Productions series of films, Dr. No, was being filmed nearby. On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service is the second book in what is known as the &#34;Blofeld trilogy&#34;, which begins with Thunderball and concluded with You Only Live Twice. The story centres on Bond&#39;s ongoing search to find Ernst Stavro Blofeld after the Thunderball incident; through contact with the College of Arms in London Bond finds Blofeld based in Switzerland. After meeting him and discovering his latest plans, Bond attacks the centre where he is based, although Blofeld escapes in the confusion. Bond meets and falls in love with Contessa Teresa &#34;Tracy&#34; di Vicenzo during the story. The pair marry at the end of the story but Blofeld kills Bond&#39;s wife hours after the ceremony. Fleming made a number of revelations about Bond&#39;s character within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming&#39;s other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or had heard of and Blofeld&#39;s research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races. On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service received broadly good reviews in the British and American press. The novel was adapted to run as a three-part story in Playboy in 1963 and then as a daily comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper in 1964-1965. In 1969, the novel was adapted as the sixth film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series and was the only film to star George Lazenby as Bond.</p><p>Born in London in 1908, Ian Fleming worked as a banker and journalist before serving in the British Naval Intelligence during World War II. He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<p><b>1. SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>The European Philosophers from Descartes to Nietzsche (Modern Library)</h2><p>"Between the earliest and the latest of the works included here, we have two hundred and fifty years of vigorous and adventurous philosophizing," Monroe Beardsley writes in his introduction to this collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the modern period can be only vaguely or arbitrarily bounded, it can at least be studied, and we can ask whether any dominant themes, overall patterns of movement, or notable achievements can be found within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is one that is best asked by the reader after he has read, or read around in, these works."&nbsp;&nbsp;Selections have been made from the writings of twelve European philosophers.&nbsp;&nbsp;These include:<br><b>Descartes</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Discourse on Method</b><br><br><b>Pascal</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Thoughts</b><br><br><b>Spinoza</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Nature of Evil"<br><br><b>Leibniz</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Relation Between Soul and Body"<br><br><b>Rousseau</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Social Contract</b><br><br><b>Kant</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Critique of Pure Reason</b><br><br><b>Fichte</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Vocation of Man</b><br><br><b>Hegel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Introduction to the Philosophy of History</b><br><br><b>Schopenhauer</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The World as Will and Idea</b><br><br><b>Comte</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A General View of Positivism</b><br><br><b>Mach</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of the Physical to the Psychical</b><br><br><b>Nietzsche</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beyond Good and Evil</b></p><p>"Today, then, as I have suitably freed my mind from all cares, and have secured for myself an assured leisure in peaceful solitude, I shall at last apply myself earnestly and freely to the general overthrow of all my former opinions." <br><br>--Rene Descartes<b>The Modern Library</b> has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Love your neighbor. The rest is commentary. Simple in theory becomes much more difficult when your neighbor is a man in a dress who stinks like urine and a decaying, unwashed body. And yet, that&#39;s exactly who you find on a downtown bus: the homeless, the unsavory, the just plain weird. Drawing on the wisdom of the Desert Fathers and Mothers, this book explores one woman&#39;s complex and ambivalent interactions with the homeless. Stories about a persistent failure to acknowledge and honor the humanity of the homeless are evidence of the pervasive reality of human sin. But at the same time, there are moments of genuine kindness and humanity that stand as reminders that God brings new life from the brokenness of sin. These stories of days spent on a downtown bus move from unflinching self-reflection to a new awareness of God&#39;s presence. This is where the abstract becomes local, and where theology finally gets real.</p><p></p><h2>The Pardon: A Novel</h2><p>After getting a confessed killer off on a technicality, brilliant young defense attorney Jack Swyteck, estranged son of Governor Harry Swyteck, a proponent of the death penalty, finds himself framed for murder. A first novel. 75,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo. Lit Guild. Tour.</p><p>In this stunning debut novel, which combines the breakneck pace of John Grisham's <i>The Firm</i> with the murderous suspense of James Patterson's <i>Along Came a Spider</i>, an estranged father and son must find common ground to survive the machinations of a psychopath bent on serving his own twisted vision of justice.James M. Grippando is a trial lawyer who lives in south Florida. His is the author of <i>The Pardon</i>.<p>The HarperPaperbacks interview with James Grippando, author of The Informant.</p><p>Q: Your latest book,<i> The Informant</i>, deals with a serial killer whose barbaric method of murder is sure to leave your reader speechless. Or should I say tongue-tied? How did you come up with the serial killer's signature of murder?<br>A: I don1t believe in using violence for shock value. That is to say, I didn1t think of the signature and then build a character around it. I created a character and then developed a signature that suited his complex motivations. John Douglas, the FBI agent who pioneered criminal profiling, often says that to understand the serial killer, you have to look closely at his work. I took that advice to heart in choosing the killer's signature in The Informant.</p><p>Q: The descriptions you gave of the FBI and their part in catching the serial killer read with the authenticity of an insider, as says former FBI agent John Douglas. The events that led up to catching the serial killer involved profiler and tactical knowledge. What kind of research did you do for this?<br>A: I started by reading the leading books on profiling and serial killers. I read everything I could get my hands on. I reviewed FBI training materials slides, videotapes, case studies. Once I felt educated, I talked with professionals who actually do this kind of work. One of the more helpful sources was a psychiatrist who examines criminal defendants to determine whether they're competent to stand trial. The most help, however, came from law enforcement personnel, particularly an FBI agent with whom I kept a running dialogue throughout the drafting of the novel.</p><p>Q: Nobody likes a snitch. The serial killer takes his dislike of squealers to the extreme. How do you feel about snitches?<br>A: "Snitch" has such a negative connotation, but it all depends on the person's motivation. Whistleblowers who expose corruption in government or dangers in work areas, for example, are often labeled "Snitches" even though their only motivation is to clear their conscience or to correct an injustice. Others spill their guts only if there is something in it for them be it money, a perverse satisfaction in seeing others get in trouble or the chance to go on television talk shows and bask in their fifteen minutes of fame. Those are the ones nobody likes, and I don't like them either.</p><p>Q: At the root of this novel is a very moving love story between Mike Posten and his wife Karen. It is incredible how you were able to link two seemingly incongruous things like a serial killer1s impetus for murder and a failing marriage. At the heart of both problems seems to lie the question of trust, and the risk of betrayal. How did you see the role of trust unfold and perform in this novel?<br>A: The basic question is, who can we trust, why and what are the consequences? Karen sums it all up when she tells Mike, "Only two kinds of people can talk without inhibitions. Strangers or lovers. Everyone in between is just negotiating."</p><p>Q: Out of all the characters in your novel, who do you identify with the most, and why?<br>A: Strangely, I1d have to say Karen Posten, the wife of the male lead, Michael Posten. She agonizes about falling into that no-man's land between strangers and lovers, where there is no such thing as total honesty.</p><p>Q: <i> The Informant</i> has many plot twists and turns. The organization and structure seem quite demanding. How do you develop your ideas for your books? Do you find outlines helpful?<br>A: In the most general sense, I develop ideas by observing events and playing the "what if" game. The trigger for <i>The Informant</i> was the whole notion of "checkbook journalism." Some journalists will pay sources, others think it1s sleazy. I asked myself, "What if a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter could help catch a serial killer only by breaking his own rules and paying an anonymous informant?" All of my writing starts this way, usually with one sentence. Once I have the hook, I expand the idea to a paragraph, then to a page, then to a three page synopsis. Then I put it down for a while. If I still like it when I come back in a week or so, I develop an outline. Outlining for me is absolutely essential. I like a complex plot, but as a reader I hate to be confused. I spent three months on the outline for <i>The Informant</i> before I ever started writing.</p><p>Q: Besides your writing career, you have also practiced trial law. In what ways do your law background and experiences help your writing?<br>A: Being a good trial lawyer means being a good storyteller. I don1t mean that in a negative way. You don1t make things up as a lawyer, but to persuade a jury you have to present the facts in a way that is both compelling and believable. You have to develop a theme, decide which arguments to make and then figure out the best way to make them all within the time constraints established by the judge and by the attention span of the jurors. More than anything, having stood in a courtroom before a judge and jury has made me more sensitive to readers. I don1t bore them with digressions. I don1t use two pages when two sentences are enough. And I don1t bill them by the hour.</p><p>Q: The hardcover of your new book,<i> The Abduction</i>, is coming out in April of 1998. Can you tease us with a little description of the storyline?<br><i>The Abduction</i> is the first thriller about a presidential election in which neither candidate is a white male. It pits a charismatic white woman running against the nation1s most respected black man. A week before the November 2000 election, a child related to one of the candidates is abducted in what only appears to be politically motivated kidnapping. The real motivations run deeper, more personal. Intrigued?</p><p>Q: Do you have any advice to give for potential authors who are trying to get published?<br>A: Perseverance. My first published novel was <i>The Pardon</i> in 1994. I say "published" novel because my actual first novel is an unpublished script sitting on a shelf in my closet. It took me four years to write it, but it didn1t sell. I felt like quitting, but my agent encouraged me to write another. Over the next seven months, I wrote<i> The Pardon</i>. It sold to HarperCollins in two weeks and is now available all over the world in nearly a dozen different languages.

It&#39;s a thrill to watch her stumble right up until the very moment she storms the f*cking gates.&#34; -Miranda July There&#39;s no stopping Busy Philipps. From the time she was two and &#34;aced out in her nudes&#34; to explore the neighborhood (as her mom famously described her toddler jailbreak), Busy has always been headstrong, defiant, and determined not to miss out on all the fun. These qualities led her to leave Scottsdale, Arizona, at the age of nineteen to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood.

In this stunningly candid memoir, Busy opens up about chafing against a sexist system rife with on-set bullying and body shaming, being there when friends face shattering loss, enduring devastating personal and professional betrayals from those she loved best, and struggling with postpartum anxiety and the challenges of motherhood.</p><p></p><h2>Ara&#39;s Field (Children of the Triad)</h2><p>Ara&#39;s Field Children of the triad</p><p></p><h2>Harvard Hates America: The Odyssey of a Born-Again American</h2><p>LeBoutillier exposes the elitism and hypocrisy that he encountered at Harvard, the weaknesses of the Republican party, and the ways in which the Harvard Business School fosters a big-business mentality without a sense of public responsibility</p><p></p><h2>India Series: Hampi</h2><p>Hampi explores one of the most beautiful and evocative of all historical sites in south India.</p><p>George Michell trained as an architect in Melbourne, and then obtained a PhD in Indian Archaeology at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, with a dissertation on Early Chalukya temples. Since then he has undertaken numerous documentation and research projects, most recently with John M. Fritz at Hampi. Surendra Kumar studied information technology in Bengaluru, and now works part-time as a photographer, specializing in panoramic topographic views. His work has been spectacularly showcased in Discovering the Deccan (Pictor, Mumbai)From Chapter 1: Commonly known as Hampi, the site of the imperial city of Vijayanagara is located on the Tungabhadra river in central Karnataka, near the border with Andhra Pradesh. Vijayanagara's fame derives from its role as capital of South India's largest, wealthiest and most powerful kingdom; hence its name, 'City of Victory'. Yet Hampi is not only of interest for its historical prestige and magnificent ruins; its remarkable landscape, religious associations and ongoing archaeological investigations make it an outstanding destination of international significance.<p>ARCHITECTURE &amp; ART</p><p>As the seat of imperial power, Vijayanagara was also a place of outstanding importance for architecture and the arts. The kings and their families, as well as their commanders and officers, not only erected buildings that bore their names, but also commissioned works of art, though none of these have survived the destruction of 1565. Since religious architecture was built of solid granite blocks laid without any mortar, it has survived to give a picture of the development of temple styles over a period of more than 200 years. The earliest Vijayanagara temples are the 14th-century shrines on Hemakuta hill. These elegant structures are built in a typical local idiom, comprising entrance porches with balcony seating, halls or mandapas with simple columns and double brackets, and shrines topped with pyramidal towers, all executed in granite. Temple architecture in the 15th century was expanded and elaborated, partly under the influence of the Tamil country incorporated into the Vijayanagara empire. The Hazara Rama temple in the middle of the royal centre is the finest example of this Tamil inspired idiom, as is evident from the finely worked decoration of its basement mouldings and plastered walls. The brick and plaster tower over the sanctuary that rises in a succession of diminishing storeys also follows the Tamil tradition. The sanctuary is approached through a spacious mandapa with entrance porches on three sides.</p><p>The climax of temple architecture at Vijayanagara occurred under the Tuluvas, beginning with Krishnadevaraya who added a magnificent mandapa to the Virupaksha temple complex at Hampi on the occasion of his coronation. He also built a multi-storeyed towered gateway, or gopura (replaced in later times), to serve as a monumental entrance to the newly renovated temple. Ultimately of Tamil origin, such spacious mandapas and lofty gopuras became hallmarks of the mature Vijayanagara style, to be repeated in all the later monuments of any magnitude at the capital, and reaching its artistic high point in the Vitthala temple complex. Like the other major complexes, the Vitthala is laid out in a linear sequence of manadapas leading to the shrine of the divinity surrounded by a narrow unlit passageway. Associated goddesses and related deities are accommodated in smaller shrines standing freely within the walled compound of the temple.</p><p>These architectural developments were accompanied by vibrant sculptural tradition, best seen in the mythological figures and narratives and the accessory maidens and guardians carved in relief onto granite columns, walls and ceilings. Highlights of Vijayanagara's sculptures include the reliefs on the Hazara Rama temple, where two entire cycles of Ramayana episodes are portrayed in stone, each episode of the story forming the subject of a separate composition. The royal reliefs on the outer compound walls of the same monument, portraying animals, soldiers and courtly women, are unique in South Indian art, as are the similarly royal subjects covering the granite sides of the nearby Mahanavami platform. Sculpture at Vijayanagara is also found on boulders scattered all over the site, either as relief compositions, such as Ramayana scenes or figures of Virabhadra and Hanuman as Anjaneya, or as gigantic three-dimensional monoliths of Ganesha or Narasimha. The technical virtuosity in the handling of the granite medium on this monumental scale is typical of Vijayanagara art. </p><p>Plaster sculptures also adorned the city's temples, as can be seen on sanctuary towers and gopuras where gods and goddesses are often flanked by courtly devotees. Similar plaster figures adorned the royal residences, but these are too fragmentary to be identified. Bronze icons must have been installed in temple sanctuaries, but not one example of the period survives at the site. (The brass images currently worshipped in the Virupaksha temple complex at Hampi are modern creations.)</p><p>Only the faintest indications of the Vijayanagara period painting are seen in the temples, and no details can be made out, though surely they would have portrayed mythological topics. (The well-preserved paintings on the ceiling of Krishnadevaraya's mandapa in the Virupaksha temple date only from the 19th-century renovation.) Murals may also have graced the halls of the royal palaces, but these have completely vanished, together with the dyed and printed cottons, woven velvets and embroidered cloths, as well as the ivory thrones and beds, and gilded metallic thresholds, door frames and roof pinnacles.</p><p>No account of the architecture of Vijayanagara would be complete without taking note of structures within the royal centre, such as the Lotus Mahal and elephant stables, built in a distinctly Islamic manner. Inspired by contemporary architecture of the neighbouring Bahmani kingdom, these and other buildings in similar style have Islamic pointed arches, vaults and domes, and are decorated with cut plasterwork in stylized floral forms. This creative interaction with the Deccan artistic tradition should be considered as a manifestation of the cosmopolitan spirit of Vijayanagara courtly culture.</p></p><h2>The Faith We Sing Worship Planner</h2><p><p>This essential tool contains introduction and acknowledgments, informative articles, and commentary (history, when, and how to use) for all 284 songs.

If, for example, you were an English major in college, you would go into book or magazine publishing, journalism, or teaching, or apply to law school. If you were an econ major, you more than likely planned on a job in finance. End of story.<br><br>The new rule: Your education taught you skills and gave you experiences that brought you to where you are today&#x2014;but now your past is a platform to spring forward from, not a ball and chain. Plus, your career path can be plotted from not only your education, but also your strengths, innate talents, personal interests, and core values. Maybe you&#x2019;ll use the communication skills you picked up as an English major, your attention to detail, and your love for creativity and design to land a job in event planning. Or social media and community management. Or as a museum curator. The choice is yours.<br><br>The Keys to Your Kingdom<br><br>In the old world of work, the decisions you made at age seventeen or eighteen years old&#x2014;like choosing a college and a major&#x2014;dictated not only your first job but likely your entire career path (just think about how crazy that is!). Moreover, the trajectory of that path was assumed to be linear: that as time passed, you would naturally get promoted, sometimes move between companies, and eventually reach a high position from which you would someday retire. You probably followed that path blindly; since it so clearly dictated your direction, you didn&#x2019;t need to stop and think about what you wanted. As a result, there were few opportunities to change or adjust course based on your unique values, skills, and aspirations. Like in kindergarten, you were assigned a seat, and you were required to sit there for the rest of the year.<br><br>It seems pretty clear that that concept of a predetermined career path has outlived its relevance. Some years ago, it was briefly challenged by an overly expansive (and somewhat ungrounded) &#x201c;follow your star&#x201d; approach, where people were advised to &#x201c;live their dreams and the money will follow.&#x201d; There was a sense that instead of a rigid, cookie-cutter plan, you didn&#x2019;t need any plan; that over time, as you moved from job to job, you would gain more and more self-knowledge, culminating in steady promotions and raises, and one day, the holy grail: comfortable retirement.<br><br>If only that always worked out.<br><br>The New Rules ask us to answer alternate questions that stem from a radically different point of view. Instead of assuming the path is preordained or that it will appear miraculously by simply wanting it to do so, we need to understand&#x2014;and accept&#x2014;that we are in charge of our own path. No major, no degree, no parental connections, no industry, company, or proverbial north star is going to determine or decide where we are going. It&#x2019;s up to us to choose the destination that is right for us and then design the path that will make it happen. Unlike in kindergarten, if we don&#x2019;t like the seat we&#x2019;ve been assigned, we can get up and move to another. In fact, we can even pick up and switch to a new classroom or school altogether. We&#x2019;re in charge of ourselves.<br><br>And this is great: What freedom! What possibility! What self-empowerment! But we also know that with all of this potential for great success and happiness comes something else: What terror! What pressure! What stress! What if we make a mistake? A wrong move, a poor choice, a stupid decision? We&#x2019;ll be destined to wallow in a career we hate forever, right?<br><br>Wrong. Because here&#x2019;s another great thing about the New Rules: we live in a culture where the world of work will continue to change rapidly. That&#x2019;s why we think of career planning as a series of two-to-five-year steps, to make thoughtfully and one at a time. So you are here now, trying to figure out your path for just the next two to five years. Not for the rest of your life. Sure, if you have long-term plans, we will help you tailor your Now Plan to your Big Plan, but in general, the advice in this book is going to be focused on that two-to-five-year horizon; on getting you ready to make the most of what you are doing today and for the next few years. The best part is, you can return to it again and again&#x2014;the practices and thought exercises we&#x2019;re doing here will serve you not only now, but next time you&#x2019;re ready for another step, shift, or reinvention in your career.<br><br>Who Are You Now?<br><br>Of course, it&#x2019;s hard to shake off the urge to try to determine your life as soon as you graduate from college. We get it, because we&#x2019;ve been there. Take Kathryn, for example. After majoring in international relations and French, she always dreamed that she would end up in foreign service or become a diplomat. Her interest in travel, her love of languages, and her natural inclination to jump in and solve problems seemed to fit exactly with the career she had imagined for herself. Yet a few weeks into what had seemed like a dream position working at the US embassy in Cyprus, Kathryn felt that interest wane. The problems her team was tackling were important, but solutions moved the needle by inches and progress could sometimes take years, requiring unbelievable patience. When colleagues noticed her penchant for offering to roll up her sleeves and get to work right away, they would laugh and suggest she consider a different field where she could make an impact more quickly. Kathryn&#x2019;s expectations ran smack into the realities of working in the foreign service, and she suddenly realized it might not be such a solid long-term fit after all.<br><br>It was as if a tether to her mental image of career satisfaction had been severed and she was totally adrift. &#x201c;It was incredibly frustrating,&#x201d; she remembers. &#x201c;I thought I had it all figured out, and suddenly I realized that I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing for the next year, let alone for the rest of my life. I&#x2019;d invested so much in a career path I was about to walk away from. It&#x2019;s funny to look back and remember how much I was worried I&#x2019;d &#x2018;wasted&#x2019; that time. But now I realize that those years were anything but. They were useful&#x2014;time to test myself&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;d be where I am today without them.&#x201d;<br><br>Alex had a similar experience. Growing up in France, a country where your high school choices still guide much of your career opportunity, she was forced to pick a direction at the age of fifteen. Between the sciences, literature, and economics, she picked the sciences. She was good at them, and they were valued highly in the French education system. Two years later, she again had to choose, this time between math, physics, and biology for her senior-year specialization. Alex chose biology and started learning about genetics by mating strains of fruit flies. She applied to college in the United States and moved across the Atlantic to start her studies, where she declared a major of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology (a fancy term for genetics). But after many long hours spent toiling in the lab her freshman year, Alex realized that as much as she loved learning about genetics, she didn&#x2019;t enjoy the day-to-day lab work that would be a big part of her job if she continued down this road. Genetics was an interest, yes, but not the right career for her. Facing this fact was hard, but it was also a pivotal moment that forced Alex to question her assumptions and embark on a journey of exploration and learning that brought her to the consulting company where she met Kathryn. Without these two diverging paths and the twists and turns we took, The Muse might never have come to be.<br><br>The point is: often what we think we want in our heads is actually very different from what we can learn we want in the day-to-day experience of actually living our careers. So even if you think you have your dream career all figured out, it&#x2019;s really important to go through the steps outlined in the next few chapters. The goal is to dig deep enough to have a clear understanding of what kind of job or career will make you truly happy.<br><br>What&#x2019;s different about today&#x2019;s rules is that they are all premised on your having a much keener, more concrete, and more nuanced understanding of your values, interests, and motivations. This requires not only understanding what you enjoy and what you&#x2019;re good at, but also how these interests and skills stack up against other important personal priorities. How much money do you need to live comfortably? How much flexibility do you want in your weekly schedule? How important is your job title, the name of your company, the size of your office? What kind of impact do you want to have on the world? We&#x2019;re going to help you zero in on all of these variables so that you can not only succeed at defining your path, but enjoy getting to know yourself a bit better in the process!<br><br>Knowing yourself in this way is a huge part of finding the right job, by which we mean, the right job for you, right now. So in this chapter we&#x2019;ll address the first of what we call the Three R&#x2019;s: Reflect. And by the time you complete the exercises and steps in this chapter, you will feel much more confident in your understanding of what you are looking for in a career or job. Even if you have absolutely no idea what you want to do with your life, these tools can help point you in the right direction. Of course, if you&#x2019;ve picked up this book already knowing who you are and what kind of job you are looking for, that&#x2019;s fine, too. You will still benefit from the exercises, as the reflection will only serve to underscore your confidence and sharpen your drive. Wherever you are, we&#x2019;re here to take you forward.<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to develop a special kind of self-awareness: you are going to come to know yourself in an introspective yet objective way. We are big believers in looking inward before you can expect to create the outward success you aspire to.<br><br>To start figuring out what you want in a job or in life, it helps to start by reflecting on who you are today. One of the early steps of this process is being brutally honest with how you are feeling (frazzled and fearful, confident and competent, muddled but also excited?) and where you are (in a current job that you despise, in a current job that&#x2019;s fine but not quite right, out of a job, living with your parents and unable to pay rent on your own place, in between a rock and a hard place?). You&#x2019;re going to ask yourself a couple of hard questions, but trust us, it&#x2019;ll be worth it.<br><br>Question 1: What Do You Value?<br><br>Back in the 1970s, a few social scientists came up with a way for people to deepen their understanding of themselves by &#x201c;clarifying their values.&#x201d; You can probably hear a bit of that seventies vibe in the language alone. But they were onto something: clarifying our values really helps when we are trying to figure out what we want in our lives.<br><br>In the context of creating a successful career plan, the word values refers to what in your work provides you with meaning and purpose. That might be a deep sense of creativity, or it might be making a positive contribution to society. In many ways, your values are more important than the type of work you&#x2019;re actually doing; in fact, numerous studies have shown that most people who pursue work that aligns with their values feel more satisfied and successful in their careers.<br><br>When it comes to charting a professional path, clarifying our own values can feel confusing. There are so many outside voices and perspectives that can clutter this very personal process: parents&#x2019; expectations and advice, friends&#x2019; choices, society&#x2019;s collective ideas about the &#x201c;right&#x201d; path. It&#x2019;s time to shut all those out. Remember, we&#x2019;re talking about your life&#x2014;and your values&#x2014;not your well-meaning mom&#x2019;s or dad&#x2019;s, not your favorite professor&#x2019;s, not your brilliant roommate&#x2019;s. They&#x2019;re yours, and yours alone.<br><br>The following exercise can help. We&#x2019;ve created a list of personal values that often accompany work life; assign each value a number from 1 to 4.<br><br>1: Absolutely essential to me<br><br>2: Desirable, but not essential<br><br>3: Of neutral value&#x2014;neither important nor unimportant to me<br><br>4: Not of value to me; I would prefer to avoid<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry about spreading the numbers out evenly among the different categories&#x2014;this isn&#x2019;t an exact science&#x2014;but do try to keep the number of 1&#x2019;s to around three (which will help you with an exercise we&#x2019;ll walk you through later on!). Most important, though, just be honest and candid with yourself.<br><br>Mission and Impact<br><br>___Social change: I want to make a contribution to society at large.<br><br>___Service: I want to be directly involved in helping individuals.<br><br>___Influence: I want my work to shape and influence the thinking of others.<br><br>___Decision making: I want to have a meaningful role in deciding direction and policy in my field.<br><br>___Ethics: I want my work to connect directly with my own principles and morals.<br><br>___Community: I want my work to be of direct benefit to the community in which I live.<br><br>Social Interaction, Collaboration, and Teamwork<br><br>___Sociability: I want to engage regularly with people as part of my daily work.<br><br>___Solitude: I want to work alone or mostly alone, without substantial engagement with others.<br><br>___Teamwork: I want to work as part of a collaborative team on projects and assignments.<br><br>___Management: I want to lead and directly supervise the work of others.<br><br>___Autonomy: I want to work independently, with minimal direction or supervision.<br><br>Routine<br><br>___Deadlines: I want to work under time-sensitive conditions, where there is pressure to deliver.<br><br>___Variation: I want my tasks and responsibilities to vary regularly.<br><br>___Consistency: I want a routine of tasks and responsibilities that remains largely the same.<br><br>___Detail: I want to engage in work where attention to detail, precision, and/or accuracy matter a great deal.<br><br>___Flexibility: I want the ability to influence my schedule in a way that works for me.<br><br>___Travel: I want to travel regularly for work, experiencing new places.<br><br>Reward<br><br>___Acknowledgment: I want to receive public acknowledgment for my professional accomplishments.<br><br>___Compensation: I want my work to deliver significant financial reward.<br><br>___Security: I want a position and a salary that are likely to remain secure.<br><br>___Prestige: I want to work in a role or at a company that is valued by others.</p><h2>The crunch: An irreverent trip through the NFL, from rookie year to a world championship to the player&#39;s strike</h2><p>A wry, witty look at life with the Dallas Cowboys during the heyday of Tom Landry and Roger Staubach, The Crunch shows the real life that makes legends and lacerates the Cowboys mechanistic corporate image, revealing a world that is both more and less than we expect, yet funnier than we could imagine.Peter Gent, author of North Dallas FortyMore characters than War and Peace.

It is a species, but it is divided into several convenient races, like Black, White, Asian, and Mixed. These divisions are based on subtle biological differences, and expressed physiologically in things like skin color, eye slantiness, and leg ashiness. Racism is the dislike of another race as a whole, or of another person solely because he is a member of a certain race.</p><p>As the title implies, this book is meant to serve as a practical guide to racism, for both racists and non-racists alike. It will explore the different stereotypes associated with members of different races and ethnic groups, as well as their origin and basis in fact. Are Swedish women really able to suck the chrome off a trailer hitch? No, of course not, but the stereotype is rooted in their extraordinary talent for oral sex.</p><p>We will also look at historical examples of racism, especially here in America, and the extent to which racism has been institutionalized or officially sanctioned,1. but mostly we will be dealing with the use of stereotypes, epithets, and racial caricatures.</p><p>Like this one. This one doesn&#x2019;t even make sense.</p><p>Fig. 1. &#x201c;An Irish Jig&#x201d;</p><p>Fig. 2. &#x201c;The Irish Frankenstein&#x201d;</p><p>The concept of race is controversial, since variation within the traditionally established races is often far more extreme than between any two ethnic groups, but to say that we don&#x2019;t divide each other into races would be to ignore thousands of years of human history. Not to mention the fact that white people drive a car like this:</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>While black people drive a car like this:</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Despite increasing globalization and intermarriage, or &#x201c;miscegenation,&#x201d; there are still distinct and important differences between members of the different races. Since the subtlety and scope of those differences are far too complicated to be helpful to us in everyday life, we employ certain heuristics, or &#x201c;stereotypes,&#x201d; to better understand and more comfortably interact with those different from ourselves. Like the Maori.</p><p>Such stereotypes are sometimes controversial, because they can oversimplify the differences between individuals. Every person is different, and it is rare for someone to fit a stereotype perfectly. Except for so-called &#x201c;walking stereotypes,&#x201d; like Carson from Queer Eye.2. Others don&#x2019;t have any of the characteristics ascribed to their race in such stereotypes. It&#x2019;s an imperfect science at best.</p><p>For example, just because the Maori are, in general, lazy, selfish, and long-winded, that does not mean that noted Maori opera singer Kiri Te Kanawa is any of those things. In fact, she is only two of them, because she is a soprano, and sopranos tend to be very succinct.</p><p>Even so, stereotypes can be very useful in our everyday social interactions and decision-making. They are actually a kind of survival instinct&#x2014;a crude form of received inductive reasoning that can help us make snap judgments in situations where we don&#x2019;t have all the facts.</p><p>When entering into a business deal with someone of Roma descent, for instance, I am very careful of my possessions. Knowing the stereotype that gypsies are tramps and thieves,3. I am able to better protect myself when coming into contact with them, and my increased vigilance might save me from becoming a victim. At any moment, a baby could come flying at me and, when I catch it, a young, dark-haired girl will steal my camera.</p><p>(If you find yourself confronted with this particular scam, it is better to drop the baby. Another little known stereotype is that gypsy children are unusually sturdy.)</p><p>Similarly, if I were looking for someone to lend me money, a Jewish person would be unlikely to help me, because they are traditionally parsimonious. It is best not to even ask, at the risk of being subjected to one of their patented &#x201c;guilt trips&#x201d; or, worse, jewed out of what money I do have.4.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why words like &#x201c;jewed&#x201d; and &#x201c;gypped&#x201d; exist. Are you calling Noah Webster a racist?</p><p>I bring this up because it is important to keep in mind the difference between stereotypes and racism. Stereotypes are a useful, if flawed, mechanism for surviving in a multicultural world, but racism is saying them out loud.</p><p>Racism is about more than just making impolitic comments, though; it is about hatred. Broad stereotypes often fuel racism, but merely believing a stereotype about another race doesn&#x2019;t make you a racist.5. After all, some of my best friends are members of other races. So stereotypes are kind of a sine qua non of racism&#x2014;a without which not of hating people different from yourself, if you will.</p><p>Racism doesn&#x2019;t need to stop at personal distaste, though. Many racists in positions of power have used their standing to oppress and even kill entire groups of people. I can&#x2019;t condone that kind of violence, but it&#x2019;s hard to argue with the science behind it. If eugenics and racialist phrenology have taught us nothing else, it&#x2019;s that we can, through selective breeding, eliminate all those with a pronounced ideality lump on their left temple.6.</p><p>Being labeled a racist in today&#x2019;s society can be extremely damaging to your reputation and your career, whether you&#x2019;re a stand-up comedian, a movie star, or a radio host. And if you&#x2019;re a true racist, minorities will be able to tell. They have an innate ability to sense when someone is being racist, a kind of radar for racism that I call &#x201c;racism-dar,&#x201d; or &#x201c;ra-dar.&#x201d;</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>This book is divided into nine chapters, each devoted to a different ethnic group: Jews, Asians, Whites, Blacks, Gypsies, Indians (and Injuns), Hispanics, Arabs, and Merpeople,7. and several appendices, including a glossary of racial epithets. Anyone who&#x2019;s ever thought about dating outside his own race will surely appreciate my guide to jungle fever, yellow fever, and the other various and sundry fevers.</p><p>Within each chapter we will consider not just broad ethnic stereotypes, like &#x201c;South Africans are cowards,&#x201d; but more specific generalities as well, like &#x201c;Swazi men are meth-heads.&#x201d; Lazy Guatemalans and industrious El Salvadorans are both covered in the chapter on Hispanics.</p><p>To sum up, racism is the hatred of members of another ethnic group solely because of their race, and it is often informed by negative and untrue stereotypes. It&#x2019;s okay to hate someone because of who they are, but hating them because of their ethnicity alone is racist. Over the next nine chapters we&#x2019;ll look at the history, etymology, and practical applications of racism in this country today.</p><p>And just in case there was any confusion, the human race is not actually a race, like a footrace, either. If it were, the blacks probably would have won.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>HISPANICS</p><p>A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO FECUNDITY</p><p></p><p></p><p>Now, more than ever, it is important to be familiar with our spicy neighbors to the south, the Hispanics.</p><p>Everyone&#x2019;s heard the stereotypes. &#x201c;They like tacos.&#x201d; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re tiny.&#x201d; &#x201c;They have big ears and are often carried around in women&#x2019;s purses.&#x201d; But did you know that Hispanics, or &#x201c;Mexicans,&#x201d; are also hardworking tradesmen and small businesspeople?1. It&#x2019;s true.</p><p>Fig. 1. A typical Hispanic</p><p>Hispanics play an important role in American society, doing the work that Americans don&#x2019;t want to do, and secreting a pungent, waxy substance known as ambergris, which is used as a fixative in some expensive perfumes. An increased demand for cheap labor and high-end fragrances brings millions of Hispanics to the United States every year. And they squeeze out babies faster than the Latvians, so their numbers are only increasing. According to a recent study, by 2015 the population of the United States will be 78 percent Mexican.</p><p>U.S. POPULATION 2015</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>That&#x2019;s why many are calling for immigration reform, to prevent more Hispanics from coming here and taking low-paying jobs away from real Americans. Though, in many cases, these are jobs that American workers are too lazy to do, like playing shortstop.</p><p>But who are these fence-hopping visitors from &#x201c;down under,&#x201d; and do they deserve to be our scapegoats? Before we retroactively leap to judgment, it&#x2019;s important to learn more about the individuals who make up this new, Yellow-Brown Peril.</p><p>For starters, the Hispanics you see every day aren&#x2019;t your everyday Mexicans. Only the very highest achievers make it to America. After completing degree work in one of several fields, their final examination consists of an intensive obstacle course between their homes and the hinterlands of southern Texas. While these skilled, motivated Hispanics can find a wide variety of demeaning work here in America, in their home countries the vast majority of them must make a living by diving for oysters or pennies thrown into the water by tourists.</p><p>Of course, Hispanics can&#x2019;t work all the time. They also enjoy a variety of leisure pursuits, such as football, though they seem to be a little unclear on the rules. They are also skilled baseball players, due to early, pi�ata-based training, and in the evening they amuse themselves by playing enormous, oversized guitars.2. American music is popular, as well; just as Germans love David Hasselhoff and Iraqis can&#x2019;t get enough Lionel Richie, Hispanics are obsessed with the alt-pop stylings of songwriter Duncan Sheik.3.</p><p>The stereotypes you tend to hear about Hispanics are, for the most part, accurate: they are a friendly people, prone to narcolepsy in the afternoon hours, and their women have phenomenal asses. Mexicans, sometimes called &#x201c;Latin&#x201d; or &#x201c;Latino&#x201d; for their love of Martial&#x2019;s epigrams, are also known throughout the world as wonderful lovers, but that is, unfortunately, not the case. The Latin Lover stereotype comes from the fact that Hispanic men are very successful seducers of women,4. but when it comes to the actual mechanics of intercourse, they are woefully inadequate. This inability to satisfy their partners is the origin of the phrase &#x201c;dos pump chump.&#x201d;</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Not all Hispanic people are alike, though, so before we go any further it&#x2019;s important to start looking at all the different kinds of Mexicans, like South Americans, Central Americans, Iberians, and Carabiners.</p><p>THE HISPANIC WORLD</p><p>Have you ever wondered who that is down there mowing your lawn? What about the fellow over there cleaning your pool? And who&#x2019;s that young chica wiping fingerprints off the sliding door? Chances are they&#x2019;re all Hispanic, but that can mean a lot of different things.</p><p>Some things are common to all Mexicans. They all speak Spanglish, for example, and they all practice either voodoo or Catholicism.5. But despite a common language, and love of switchblade knives, there are many regional subtleties that are not readily apparent to the lay non-Mexican.</p><p>By the way, if you don&#x2019;t know how to speak Spanglish, it&#x2019;s really quite easy: all you have to do is add &#x201c;-o&#x201d; to the end of every other word, and remember a few made-up ones like &#x201c;biblioteca&#x201d; and &#x201c;aqu�.&#x201d; It can even be fun to tell your contractor to &#x201c;put the drywall-o aqu�, not aqu�.&#x201d; Be warned, though: It all seems relatively harmless now, but I&#x2019;m told some extremist pro-Mexican apologistas actually want it taught in our schools. The last thing we need in academia is foreign languages other than Greek and Latin.</p><p>Hispanic countries are more than just a great place to assuage your white guilt by doing a year or two of ineffectual community service after college.6. They are a rich collage of scary, foreign cultures. Let us now consider in turn the four regions of Hispania: Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Iberia.</p><p>MEXICO</p><p>Of the three countries in North America, this, the southernmost one, is where most Mexicans can be found. But, much like the killer bees never actually did, they are spreading into all areas of the United States.</p><p>Known for its energetic hat dancing, Mexico is actually a totalitarian oligarchy. It is governed by a group of Latin Kings, like Tarquin the Proud, who rule the country with an iron fist. They are not to be confused with the Latin Kings of Comedy, whose domain is limited to late-night filler on Comedy Central. Nor should they be confused with Latin Inches, which is a fine publication.</p><p>The Latin Kings&#x2019; influence also extends to Mexican emigrants in America, which is troubling, because they seem to be extraordinarily tolerant of criminal behavior. Like much of the Hispanic world, Mexico is overrun with scofflaws and roustabouts, in addition to roving bands of lawless banditos (literally, &#x201c;roving bands&#x201d;). Of these, none was more fearsome than the ruthless Frito Bandito, who traveled the Mexican countryside in the early 1970s, robbing tourists of their salted corn chips.</p><p>But the most famous bandito was probably the revolutionary leader Pancho Villa. Villa was, of course, General John Pershing&#x2019;s white whale, which is ironic, because he was Mexican.</p><p>As with all races, it&#x2019;s important to be tolerant of Mexicans, but also vigilant, especially with your personal possessions. Unlike American law enforcement, the police in Mexico are overweight and corrupt. To give you an idea of just how bad it is, the Mexican Law &amp; Order is only half an hour long, and usually ends in the beating death of an innocent suspect.</p><p>To be fair, their jobs are also more difficult than those of the American police. Mexicans, as a race, are very fleet-footed, or &#x201c;speedy,&#x201d; and extremely diminutive in stature. They are almost rodent-like in this respect. &#x201c;Arriba! Arriba!&#x201d; you can hear them cry, as they elude their pursuers.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mexican leaders and police seem ambivalent, especially about the overt criminal activities of the country&#x2019;s two most famous citizens, comedians Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong.7. On one occasion, the pair even drove a va...</p></p><h2>Little Gnome Facts</h2><p>ISBN 0-8109-0963-4 1981, 1982 Harry N. Abrams, Inc.

This is their story.INXS broke new musical ground. In songs such as &#34;The One Thing,&#34; &#34;Need You Tonight,&#34; &#34;New Sen-sation,&#34; &#34;Never Tear Us Apart,&#34; and &#34;Suicide Blonde&#34; they turned rock, pop, and funk into a cutting edge, danceable style that took the world by storm. Touring the globe, they grew up together and made new fans on every continent. In this autobiography, they reveal for the first time everything they experienced in their more than two decades of making music: the partying, the pressure, the wild times on the road, the heights and depths of rock-star life, the bonds of brotherhood and friendship that got them through the tough times and made the fun times even more intense. They talk about the sadness of watching their closest friend and collaborator, Michael Hutchence, slipping away from them and share their thoughts about why he left them far too soon.Much has been written about INXS over the years, but nothing before has been authorized by the group or has reflected their point of view. This is INXS&#39;s story--one that they weren&#39;t ready to talk about until now--and the book that every rock fan will need to own.INXS consists of Andrew, Tim, and Jon Farriss, Kirk Pengilly, and Garry Beers. The band&#39;s sixth member, Michael Hutchence, died in 1997. In 2005, they starred in the international television phenomenon Rock Star: INXS, in which they conducted a global search for a new lead singer.

It couldn&#x2019;t have stalled. Daddy had just picked it up today. There was nothing wrong with anything, it had a full tank of gas--<br><br>But it had died way out here on 101st, and now it wasn&#x2019;t responding at all.<br><br>And this was a spooky place to get stranded past midnight. You might as well be in West Texas instead of less than twenty miles from downtown Tulsa. There wasn&#x2019;t anything out here but cows and cicadas, mysterious shadows, and an awful lot of dark.<br><br>Visions of the Rainy-day Rapist and the Southside Strangler kept popping into her head, making her look over her shoulder as she tried to get the damn car started one more time.<br><br>No luck. And now the tears did come; she sobbed in what she told herself was frustration but felt more like fear. God, this is like the classic slasher-movie setup, girl stuck out on a deserted road at three a.m.--next thing I&#x2019;ll see is a guy in a hockey mask--<br><br>She shivered and told herself not to be stupid. There was a gas station not a half mile behind her--it was closed, but there was a phone there. She could call the auto club. That was why Daddy had a gold card with them.<br><br>Resolutely--though it took every bit of courage she had--she left the protection of the car and started the long trudge back toward the Kerr/McGee station. But she kept seeing things out of the corner of her eye, things that vanished when she looked straight at them, and before long she wasn&#x2019;t walking, she was running.<br><br>She&#x2019;d never been so grateful to see a gas station in her life.<br><br>She fumbled the last quarter out of her purse--this was one of those phones where you couldn&#x2019;t use a charge card, and you had to put a quarter into it even to call 911. She was just glad she hadn&#x2019;t dumped all her change, back at the mall, when Fay Harper had sneered at her for putting cash in the liver-transplant box. Fay had made her so damn mad--just because she&#x2019;d beaten the senior out on the Teenage America finals, that was no reason for Fay to imply she&#x2019;d gotten that far by sleeping with one of the judges--<br><br>Well, neither of them made it to the regionals, so there.<br><br>Buffie just wished Fay hadn&#x2019;t said what she did, when Buffie had retorted with the truth nobody ever said out loud.<br><br>&#x201c;You should know, Fay Harper. You get everything you want by sleeping around and passing out nose candy.&#x201d;<br><br>And Fay had said something horrible, whispered it in Buffie&#x2019;s ear. So horrible Buffie couldn&#x2019;t remember exactly what it was--just some kind of threat.<br><br>Or promise. Because it had ended with--&#x201d;And when you see what&#x2019;s coming for you, remember I sent it.&#x201d;<br><br>Buffie shoved her coin into the slot with hands that shook so hard she could hardly dial the number, and prayed for a quick answer.<br><br>&#x201c;God damn it.&#x201d; Sharon LeeMar looked at the phone resentfully. It would ring, now, when she&#x2019;d just gotten a new coat of polish on her nails. It was probably nothing; some drunk, like last night, wanting the auto club to pull the car out of the ditch where he&#x2019;d put it. Or some stupid kid who&#x2019;d missed her ride home from some rich-bitch party, and wanted them to provide her with one.<br><br>Well, there was a way around that. It wasn&#x2019;t like she hadn&#x2019;t done it before. She hit the button with her elbow. &#x201c;Big A Auto Club,&#x201c; she said. &#x201c;Will you hold?&#x201d;<br><br>And before the caller could say a word, she hit the hang-up button.<br><br>Buffie stared at the phone in gut-wrenching shock, unable to believe she was hearing a dial tone. &#x201c;No--&#x201d; she whispered, a panic that she knew was irrational starting to take over. &#x201c;No, you can&#x2019;t--&#x201d;<br><br>She scrabbled desperately in her purse, hoping for one more quarter. Nothing. With a sob, she upended the whole thing on the pavement, pawing through a tangled mess of makeup, jewelry, credit cards, and odd bits of paper, praying for a quarter, a dime, anything--<br><br>Then she heard the sound; a kind of growl. And looked up.<br><br>And the scream died in her throat before she could utter it.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>Derek Kestrel half closed his lids against the wind that was drying his eyes, and gathered breath for another bellow. &#x201c;I said,&#x201c; Deke yelled, trying to make himself audible over the bellow of the TransAm&#x2019;s engine and the painfully howling guitars of Motley Cr�e, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t hear you!&#x201d;<br><br>Fay Harper shook her head, her blond shag whipping wildly about her cheekbones. Her hair looked like spun frost under the fluorescent streetlamps, her pale skin glowed in the moonlight, and her eyes were turned to crimson embers by the reflections from the panel lights. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t hear you!&#x201d; she screamed back, turning the volume up another notch until the TransAm&#x2019;s floor panels shook from the bass.<br><br>Deke sighed and gave up, leaning back into the padded headrest of his seat. It was custom-leather upholstered, of course, in deep burgundy to match the rest of the car; Fay Harper was never seen in less than the very best. Nothing was going to compete with those speakers. Nothing natural, anyway. A B-52 at full throttle, maybe.<br><br>Hanging out with Fay was hazardous to the eardrums. He wished now he&#x2019;d brought earplugs or something. First had been the concert, front-row seats, now it was Fay&#x2019;s ass-kicking stereo; he was going to be deaf before the night was over.<br><br>Then again, hanging out with Fay Harper was hazardous to a lot more than the eardrums.<br><br>The TransAm tore down Memorial, Fay daring anything to pull into her path. Deke squinted against the headlights of the oncoming cars, assessed his blood-alcohol level by how fuzzy they looked, and came up with an answer the Parental Unit wouldn&#x2019;t like. It was a good thing his dad couldn&#x2019;t see him now. Hell, it was a good thing his dad hadn&#x2019;t seen the concert! While Deke hadn&#x2019;t shared anything but the bottle Fay&#x2019;d brought, grass had been the mildest of the recreational pharmaceuticals making the rounds tonight. Funny. Dad may have been a wild-eyed hippie back when he was Deke&#x2019;s age, but he didn&#x2019;t know the half of what went on these days. Deke said the word &#x201c;concert,&#x201c; and he could almost see nostalgic visions of Woodstock drifting through his dad&#x2019;s mind in a sunshine-golden, artistically backlit haze. The Summer of Love. Peace, pop. Like, it&#x2019;s a happening. Oh, wow.<br><br>He laughed out loud, and Fay gave him a funny look, then cranked the stereo up the last notch. His whole body throbbed and vibrated with the song. He could feel the amplifier overheating--<br><br>Or maybe the heat he felt was the effect of her hand sliding up his leg.<br><br>There was a drunken howl from the back seat, and Sandy Foster, football bohunk extraordinaire, leaned forward and handed them both cold beers, after throwing his own empty through the open T-top.<br><br>&#x201c;Kick ass, Fay!&#x201d; he shouted, as Fay gave him a smile that dazzled in the hellfire glow from the instrument panel, and a long, wet kiss in exchange for the beer. She never once took her foot off the gas, but she never swerved, and she hadn&#x2019;t missed a light yet.<br><br>There was a flash of headlights in the left lane as a couple of hopped-up metal-heads in a chop-top Cougar pulled alongside. The driver shouted something, lost in the howl of engines and the screech of feedback. Fay tossed back her head in laughter, rapped on the horn once, contemptuously. Then she gave them the finger, and blew the doors off their pitiful poser-custom.<br><br>Deke wondered if his spine was going to have a close encounter with the back seat. The speedometer was in three digits by the time his stomach caught up with the rest of him.<br><br>Sandy howled again, and another bottle hit the pavement behind them.<br><br>Deke looked back at the Cougar eating their dust. For a minute, the guy on the passenger&#x2019;s side looked a little like his buddy Alan.<br><br>He bit his lip, and wondered what Alan was doing tonight--then looked at the bottle in his hand. His conscience awoke, and sanity reared its cold, ugly head.<br><br>What in the hell am I doing here? How did I ever get mixed up with Fay&#x2019;s crowd?<br><br>Sandy was screaming along with the Cr�e; the simpleminded lyrics of any popular song were all he needed to cover his questions.<br><br>Yeah, but Sandy&#x2019;s got three answers to deal with everything he runs up against--drink it, screw it, or tackle it. Every Bud&#x2019;s for him.<br><br>Jillian McIver, Fay&#x2019;s best friend, was nuzzling Sandy&#x2019;s neck like a toothless vampire. The rest of them pretty much match Sandy. Jill&#x2019;s got no life outside the mall. Fay&#x2019;s got anything she wants. I&#x2019;m the oddball here. So what the hell do they want with me?<br><br>He glanced over at Fay; she smiled and licked her lips, and her hand reached the Promised Land. Questions began to seem pretty immaterial.... <br><br>However, Fay&#x2019;s luck with the lights ran out at just that moment. She pulled her hand away as the light changed from yellow to red. She might have tried to run it--but there was a little something bearing down on the intersection.<br><br>Deke wasn&#x2019;t so gone that he couldn&#x2019;t see the semi--and his reactions weren&#x2019;t too blown to grab for the &#x201c;aw-shit&#x201d; bar on the door as Fay cursed, locked all four wheels, and put the TransAm into a sideways drift, stopping just short of the intersection.<br><br>And as the front swung around, the headlights glared right into the eyes of the metal-brains still trying to race them. They didn&#x2019;t see the se...</p></p><h2>The Banquet&#39;s Wisdom: A Short History of the Theologies of the Lord&#39;s Supper</h2><p>&#34;The Banquet&#39;s Wisdom&#34; offers a thoughtful and concise overview of the theologies of the Eucharist during the first 1500 years of western Christianity.

With <em>Everyday Sacred</em> she shared her stories about finding the sacred in everyday life and living peacefully and simply in our hectic world. Now, in <em>Stretching Lessons,</em> her journey grows even more intimate. With her graceful storytelling and charming illustrations, Sue looks inward to discover the spirit within each of us that whispers to be heard. By listening to the wisdom of the body, she follows the urgent call we all have to become as big in spirit as we truly are. Using the metaphor of stretching to overcome our doubts and the restricted visions of our own possibilities, this book -- her most profound work to date -- offers a new way for us to stretch to our fullest spiritual self.</p><p>Sue Bender remains a pioneer on the path of the spirit, and <em>Stretching Lessons</em> offers some of her most rigorous and personal explorations. Through Sue's humble and honest grappling with her own frailties and struggles, we discover the larger life lessons that help us realize the potential that lies within us.</p></p><p>Like the delicate finger exercises that help pianists achieve great sonatas, <i>Stretching Lessons</i> reads like a series of contemplative exercises that help readers achieve great wisdom. Writing with utter humility and humanity, Sue Bender shares the private (and sometimes painful) life lessons that have helped her stretch into a bigger person. We read of Bender as a sixth-grade girl who didn't get chosen for the accelerated progress class, and how her body helped her find a face-saving solution. Sometimes her confessions are downright comforting, particularly since this author of <i>Plain and Simple</i> and <i>Everyday Sacred</i> lets us know that she still struggles with creating too much struggle: <blockquote> I <i>am</i> wiser.<p> And I am <i>still</i> struggling...</p><p> I'm sixty-six years old and I want to learn about ease. </p></blockquote> Consider this an in-and-out book, one that can be opened to any page, where readers will find brief one-to-three-page essays about stretching into one's biggest self, biggest dream, biggest life. Although it's billed as a memoir, don't expect a tightly woven literary narrative. Even so, the airy format with plenty of white space manages to convey a strong sense of Bender's life and the common ground we all find in her experiences. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><br>Sue Bender is the author of <em>Plain and Simple: A Woman's Journey to the Amish</em> (HarperSanFrancisco). The book was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. A fascination with Amish quilts led Sue to live with the Amish in their seemingly timeless world, a landscape of immense inner quiet. This privilege, rarely bestowed upon outsiders, taught her about simplicity and commitment and the contentment that comes from accepting who you are. In this inspiring book, Bender shares the lessons she learned while in the presence of the Amish people.<p>In <em>Everyday Sacred: A Woman's Journey Home</em> (HarperSanFrancisco: now in its sixth printing), Bender speaks to our longing to make each day truly count. She chronicles her struggle to bring the joyful wisdom and simplicity she experienced in her sojourn with the Amish back to her hectic, too-much-to-do days at home. Bender discovers for herself, and in the process shows us, that small miracles can be found everywhere'in our homes, in our daily activities and, hardest to see, in ourselves.</p><p>Profiles and interviews with Ms. Bender, as well as book excerpts have been published in countless national publications including <em>Reader's Digest</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Ladies' Home Journal, The Chicago Tribune, The Utne Reader</em>, and <em>W Magazine</em>. She has also appeared as a guest on dozens of radio and television shows.</p><p>Born in New York City, Sue Bender received her BA from Simmons College and her MA from the Harvard University School of Education. She taught high school in New York and English at the Berlitz School in Switzerland. She later earned a Masters in Social Work from the University of California at Berkeley. During her active years as a family therapist, Bender was founder and Director of CHOICE: The Institute of the Middle Years. In addition to being an author and former therapist, Sue Bender is a ceramic artist and much sought after lecturer nationwide. She lives in Berkeley, California with her husband Richard, and is the mother of two grown sons.</p></p><h2>Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century</h2><p>Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century is the true story of this author&#39;s contact with a &#34;dead&#34; physicist colleague, and the telepathic communication that forced him to seek scientific answers to spiritual questions such as these classics: Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going? For more than a decade, Harper embarked on a spiritual quest of careful reflection and methodical research in &#34;abnormal physics and paranormal psychology,&#34; as he says. This headstrong but heartfelt effort would plunge Harper into the depths of despair and then lift him up to the heights of ecstasy over and over again as he produced an inspired synthesis of great ideas of all ages from cream-of-the-crop scientists and spiritualists. In this unique book, Harper offers comfort far from the simplistic optimism of New Age writers through a deep sense of &#34;knowing,&#34; and that becomes obvious in the preface itself; yet his truth rings true from the first page to the last one. He never loses sight of his objective either, explaining how the mystical experience of every culture is an initiation into the fifth dimension of the shaman&#39;s consciousness. Throughout, Harper summons an astounding array of facts that lend credence to his seminal vision for the rediscovered myths of long-gone but not forgotten civilizations such as the Mayans and Egyptians, and the schools of thought espoused by so-called Freemasons. In short, he has built on a solid academic foundation that spans many disciplines: anthropology, archaeology, astronomy, astrology, physics, psychology, biology, history, mathematics, and medicine to name but a few. Moreover, this is an easy-to-read, intelligent, honest book not to be overlooked as Harper spews scientific theory and salutes spiritual teachings equally.

His girlfriend loves him; his career is going well; and every night he falls asleep knowing that his life is good and meaningful. Only when the past reveals its twisted smile in a phone call and the disconnected voice asks him to come find his father in post-Katrina New Orleans is Luke compelled to find out what kind of man he truly is. Recovering Charles is for every family who&#39;s had its share of tough times, for anyone who regrets the things you&#39;ve never said, for everyone who needs to know their life has a second verse.</p><p>Jason F. Wright is the New York Times bestselling author of Christmas Jars and The Wednesday Letters. He lives in Woodstock, Virginia with his wife, Kodi, and their four children. A sign on their door reads, Friends welcome. Family by appointment only.Recovering Charles is a reminder to families everywhere that lives do have second verses, and that the things said in anger, and those words left unsaid in the aftermath of anger, do not necessarily have to lead to a lifetime of regrets. People can, and do, change, and oftentimes life s second verse is the sweeter of the two. Recovering Charles is another inspirational Christmas season offering from Jason Wright, one with the potential to change lives for the better. --Curled Up With a Good Book Recovering Charles is a riveting story of hope, healing, and, above all, faith. I was profoundly touched by seeing my own struggles reflected in its pages and inspired by its message that life can always have a second verse. Take my advice, you don t need to read this review, you just need to read the book! --Blogger News Network<br><br>This New York Times bestselling author cuts deeply into the soul of New Orleans residents, and weaves a touching, if somewhat sentimental, tale of paternal love and emotional resurrection. Lukes personal journey to New Orleans reveals much about his father s recent life, including his recovery from alcoholism, a fascinating and mysterious fiancee, a revived musical career, and a group of intensely loyal friends who make it their personal mission to reacquaint Luke with his father. Wright has previously published three novels, The James Miracle, Christmas Jars and The Wednesday Letters, and is also a well-known political/social editorialist. In Recovering Charles, mystery and romance readers will be hooked on Lukes puzzling search and his encounter with an exotic mystery woman while in New Orleans. Readers favoring realism will suffer Lukes pain through aptly described recollections of his childhood. With a harsh dose of reality, Wright is accomplished in his use of imagery, as his descriptions of New Orleans are often graphic and moving. His plethora of New Orleans characters are intriguing and occasionally puzzling, if not particularly inspiring. In a surprising twist, the unexpected conclusion leads Luke to a place he never imagined, and leaves the reader with much to ponder. --Foreword Magazine<br><br>Take my advice, you dont need to read this review, you just need to read the book! Just go to Amazon and buy it! Oh, you are still reading, I guess I will have to explain why this is the book of the year in my mind. Jason Wright is no newcomer to the literary world and his two prior books, Christmas Jars and The Wednesday Letters, both achieved critical acclaim and also a New York Times bestseller. With these credentials you would expect Recovering Charles to be well laid out plot wise and eloquent in the use of language. It most certainly is! Some might argue that Recovering Charles is a little slow getting out of the starting blocks, however, in retrospect the first part of the book is fundamental to understanding the entire story, Jason Wright took the correct approach. I feel a very personal attachment to this book. My wife is from Slidell, which was devastated by Katrina. She did not sleep for days, frantic trying to get information about her family, all of which were in the New Orleans area. The phones were not working, the images on the TV were horrific, this was not America, it could not be happening here. These disasters happen in other countries, not at home. We spent countless hours in the internet, bits of that infrastructure were still working. We scoured NOAA reconnaissance photography, satellite pictures, we searched the lists of evacuees, we left messages on bulletin boards, and we kept dialing phone numbers. Jason Wright has encapsulated all of the emotions that we felt during that time. His descriptive writing is unparalleled, he picks up on small things, a child's broken toy, a picture frame showing a happy mother and her newborn baby. These are powerful images. Recovering Charles is an evocative and emotional read, and even though a work of fiction, I can guarantee that you will have a lump in your throat when you finish reading it. This book deserves to be on the New York Times best seller list, it certainly is one that I will remember for a very long time. As a reviewer I rarely have the luxury of time to read a book twice, I will make time for Recovering Charles. --GoArticles.com</p><h2>Support Structures (Sternberg Press)</h2><p><p><i>Support Structures</i> is a manual for what bears, sustains, and props, for those things that encourage, care for, and assist; for that which advocates, articulates; for what stands behind, frames, and maintains: it is a manual for those things that give support.

Her most recent book is Artisan&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s activity book <i>How to Build an A</i>.</p>Offering a hands-on approach to learning the alphabet, this small-format book comes with 11 off-white foam shapes (as well as a mesh storage bag). In the book, miniature, stylized people (and the occasional dog) work together to construct each letter of the alphabet, using rectangular blocks and arcs shaped just like the foam pieces. Playful, irreverent illustrations accompany each letter being constructed: for N is for Nose, two of the tiny people play in and around an elongated, drippy proboscis; with Z, the zebra participates in having his stripes painted on his back. But those interested in building three-dimensional letters, as the title promises, may be disappointed: the pieces dont fit together seamlessly. For example, if kids try to make the letter B following the illustration in the book, the vertical piece isnt long enough to accommodate both of the loops; these have to be overlapped, in which case the loop placed on top tilts sadly toward one end. (Using a set of pieces different from what is shown will solve this problem but not similar ones.) A good idea just shy of realization.

Long overshadowed by the contemporaneous American, French, and Industrial revolutions, the Romantic Revolution finally receives its due in Tim Blanning&#x2019;s bold and brilliant work.<br><br>A rebellion against the rationality of the Enlightenment, a rejection of &#x201c;the Academy&#x201d; in favor of public opinion, Romanticism was a profound shift in expression that altered the arts and ushered in modernity, even as it championed a return to the intuitive and the primitive. Blanning describes its beginnings in Rousseau&#x2019;s novel La <i>Nouvelle H�lo�se,</i> the biggest bestseller of the eighteenth century, a work that placed the creator&#x2014;and not the created&#x2014;at the center of aesthetic activity and led to the virtual worship of creative geniuses by the general public. <br><br>Blanning reveals the glamorizing of artistic madness and suicide in Goethe&#x2019;s novel <i>The Sufferings of Young Werther </i>and the ballet <i>Giselle;</i> the role of sex as a psychological force in Friedrich Schlegel&#x2019;s novel <i>Lucinde;</i> the importance of mind-altering drugs to the fictional protagonist of <i>Confessions of an English Opium Eater</i> and to the composer Hector Berlioz in his <i>Symphonie fantastique; </i>and the use of na�ve, dreamlike imagery in Goya&#x2019;s paintings of monsters, devils, and witches.<br><br>Whether it was the new notion of &#x201c;sex appeal&#x201d; in the fames of Paganini, Liszt, and Byron, or the celebration of accessible storytelling in the novels of Walter Scott (the most popular writer of the day), <i>The Romantic Revolution</i> unearths the origins of ideas now commonplace in our culture. It is the best introduction to an essential time whose influence would far outlast the mechanistic &#x201c;age of the railway&#x201d; that, in the mid-nineteenth century, replaced it.</p><p>Until his retirement in 2009, <b>Tim Blanning</b> was Professor of Modern European History at the University of Cambridge and remains a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College and of the British Academy. He is general editor of <i>The Oxford History of Modern Europe</i> and the <i>Short Oxford History of Europe</i> series and the author of <i>The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture, </i>which won a prestigious German prize and was short-listed for the British Academy Book Prize, <i>The Pursuit of Glory,</i> and <i>The Triumph of Music</i>. In 2000 he was awarded a Pilkington Prize for teaching by the University of Cambridge.Chapter 1<br><br>The Crisis of the<br><br>Age of Reason<br><br>Rousseau on the Road to Vincennes<br><br>On June 28, 1751, the first volume of the Encyclopedia, or a systematic dictionary of the sciences, arts, and crafts (better known in its abbreviated French form as the Encyclop�die), edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot, was published in Paris. Originally intended to be nothing more than a translation of Ephraim Chambers's Cyclop�dia of 1728, the project soon expanded to ten volumes and kept on growing. By the time it reached completion with a two-volume index in 1780 it covered thirty-five volumes containing more than twenty million words. This was much more than a reference work: It was underpinned by a mission to modernize. Once all knowledge had been assembled and its fundamental principles identified, the way would be clear for further progress. It was a process that necessarily involved casting a critical eye at existing institutions, customs, and values. As Diderot put it in his article on Encyclopedia: "All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone's feelings. . . . We must ride roughshod over all these ancient puerilities, overturn the barriers that reason never erected, and give back to the arts and the sciences the liberty that is so precious to them." Although the sharp eye of the censor compelled discretion, chief among those "ancient puerilities" that Diderot had his eye on was the Catholic Church.<br><br>The impact of the Encyclop�die was immediate and lasting. An instant bestseller right across Europe, it had sold more than twenty-five thousand complete sets by 1789, more than half of them outside France. Anyone who contributed to it automatically became a celebrity: "In the past," wrote Voltaire, "men of letters were not admitted into polite society, they have now become a necessary part of it." Fierce opposition from the conservative press and intermittent persecution by the authorities, culminating in an outright ban by both king and pope in 1759, helped to promote a sense of solidarity among both contributors and sympathizers, so that encyclop�diste entered the language to denote a progressive intellectual. But by the time they were forced underground, Diderot and d'Alembert had succeeded in their mission of creating an institutional center for their project of Enlightenment. Also in 1759 d'Alembert claimed in his treatise Elements of Philosophy: "A most remarkable change has taken place in our ideas, a change which by its rapidity, seems to promise us a greater one yet. . . . Our century has called itself supremely the century of philosophy."<br><br>This triumphalism derived in part from the knowledge that the Encyclop�die was only one of many major works of enlightened philosophy to have been published around the middle of the century, including Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws in 1748, the first volume of Buffon's Natural History in 1749, Condillac's Treatise on Systems, also in 1749, and Voltaire's The Age of Louis XIV in 1751. Yet at the very moment that the tide seemed to be running irresistibly in their favor, a mighty splash announced the appearance of an intrepid opponent determined to swim against the current. This was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who in July 1749 had a conversion experience while on his way to see his friend Diderot in prison at Vincennes, just outside Paris. Unable to afford a carriage, Rousseau went on foot, whiling away the time by reading the Mercure de France. His eye was struck by an advertisement for a prize essay competition staged by the Academy of Dijon. The topic was: "Has the progress of the sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals or improve them?" In his autobiography Confessions, published posthumously in 1782, Rousseau recalled: "The moment I read this I beheld another universe and became another man." In another account he went into more detail about the extreme nature of his reaction: "I felt my mind dazzled by a thousand lights. . . . I felt my head seized by a dizziness that resembled intoxication." Slumping to the ground, he spent the next hour in a kind of trance, sobbing so passionately that when he came to his senses he found his coat drenched with tears.<br><br>The reason for this effusion was Rousseau's sudden insight that the Dijon Academy's question was not rhetorical. Collecting his wits, he set about articulating his epiphany in A Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences, which won the prize and was published the following year. With all the zeal of the convert, he proclaimed that, contrary to expectation, the civilizing process was leading not to liberation but to enslavement, as it has flung "garlands of flowers over the chains which weigh us down," so that "our minds have been corrupted in proportion as the arts and sciences have improved." All the various branches of the natural sciences, he observed, have their origins in a vice: astronomy in superstition, mathematics in greed, mechanics in ambition, physics in idle curiosity. Even printing had proved to be a false friend, for it had allowed the dissemination of impious tracts, such as those of Hobbes and Spinoza. Rousseau ended his diatribe with the prediction that eventually men would become so alienated from the modern world that they would beg God to give them back their "ignorance, innocence, and poverty, the only goods that can make for our happiness and that are precious in your sight."<br><br>This was to turn the agenda of the Enlightenment on its head with a vengeance. Throwing caution to the winds, Rousseau went out of his way to distance himself from his former friends, accusing them of subverting the traditional values of patriotism and religion in pursuit of "the destruction and degradation of everything sacred among men." It took a long time for the philosophes to realize just how extreme was Rousseau's apostasy. They chose to see his Discourse as "a paradox rather than a conviction." Complacently believing that history was on their side, they moved from bewilderment to irritation to hostility, even hatred in the case of Diderot or Voltaire. Yet although they might dismiss him as a "lunatic," as Voltaire did, they could not help but notice that Rousseau's antimodernism had struck a responsive chord in many readers. What made him more dangerous was his total lack of any connection with the establishment. On the contrary, he had proved his credentials as a sea green incorruptible by ostentatiously turning his back on the offer of a royal pension in 1752. His rejection of the Enlightenment had made him more radical.<br><br>Rousseau's Lovers: From a Mimetic to an Expressive Aesthetic<br><br>Even the least perceptive of the philosophes had to wake up to the threat when in 1761 Rousseau published an epistolary novel. The title of the very first edition was Letters from two lovers living in a small town at the foot of the Alps, but it soon became known as Julie, or The New H�lo�se. Voltaire's reaction that he would rather kill himself than read such "a stupid, bourgeois, impudent and boring" book all the way through was not shared by the European reading public. By the end of the century it had gone through more than seventy editions, becoming the biggest bestseller of the century in the process. When the printing presses proved unable to keep up with demand, enterprising Parisian booksellers resorted to renting out copies by the day or even hour. Rousseau was already famous: La Nouvelle H�lo�se turned him into a cult. The fan mail that poured in-and which he carefully preserved-was remarkable as much for its intensity as for its bulk. Typical was an effusion from the cavalry captain Jean-Louis Le Cointe, which began with the apologetic exclamation: "Yet another letter from someone unknown to you!" Yet, he went on, so full was his heart that he had to overcome his reluctance to disturb the most amiable philosopher of all time. Not only had Rousseau's book made a case for morality more effectively than any sermon, he wrote, it had also shown men how they could achieve earthly happiness.<br><br>By pretending to be only the editor of a collection of letters he had stumbled on, Rousseau sought to give the novel the kind of immediacy achieved today by the better television soap operas. His success with only the written word at his disposal says a great deal for his literary skills, for he was required to assume the guise of several different characters-Julie, the long-suffering and ultimately doomed heroine; her lover, the sensitive Saint-Preux; Lord Edward Bomston, an English nobleman as warmhearted as he is rich; Wolmar, the noble atheist; and so on. Many of Rousseau's correspondents took him at his word, insisting that the events depicted had really happened and demanding to know what had happened after the end of the book. Not at all untypical was the Marquise de Polignac's anguished letter describing her reaction to Julie's death: "I dare not tell you the effect it made on me. My heart was crushed. Julie dying was no longer an unknown person. I believed I was her sister, her Claire. My seizure became so strong that if I had not put the book away I would have been as ill as those who attended that virtuous woman in her last moments."<br><br>This was not the first time that the tear ducts of eighteenth-century readers had opened their floodgates. The sentimental novels of Samuel Richardson, for example, had achieved a similar response in the 1740s. What raised Rousseau's emotional appeal above the ruck was its autobiographical dimension. As he himself observed:<br><br>What won me the women's favour was their belief that I had written my own story and that I was myself the hero of my novel. The belief was so firmly established that Mme de Polignac wrote to Mme de Verdelin, begging her to persuade me to let her see Julie's portrait. Everybody was convinced that it was impossible to express feelings so vividly unless one had felt them, or so to depict the raptures of love except with one's own heart as model. In that they were right, and it<br><br>is true that I wrot...</p><h2>Macdonald Hall #5: The Zucchini Warriors</h2><p>Praise for the Macdonald Hall series: "Korman has a unique talent for creating genuinely funny, roll-on-the-floor, laugh-out-loud books.

Once again he sets out to expose those who would appropriate Native culture and turn it into a commodity to be bought and sold. He reviews motion pictures (demonstrating the historical inaccuracies and perpetuation of stereotypes in Black Robe ) and books (calling In the Absence of the Sacred by Jerry Mander an example of "intellectual appropriation" by a supposedly sympathetic author). He turns an essay on Jack Weatherford's book, Indian Givers , into an exploration of plagiarism and publishers' penchant for books about Indians by non-Natives while works by Natives themselves go begging. Other pieces deal with the issue of products and sports teams with Indian names and the impact of government definitions of who is Indian on Native artist Jimmie Durham. The final piece examines how language oppresses and how it might be used for liberation. Churchill's controversial style and work have brought him into conflict with both Natives and non-Natives. Readers will, however, respect his passion and consistency. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Collected Works of G. K.

Miller is easy to listen to; his thick, warm voice has a slightly gravelly sound. He reads, rather than acts out, the details of his fascinating life, but he&#39;s expressive and appropriately impassioned. Al-though the tape starts with the playwright&#39;s Brooklyn childhood, it then jumps to The Death of a Salesman and then to The Crucible, leaving out any events in between. The title is very apt. A.A.B. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineAmerica's most famous living playwright (All My Sons, Death of a Salesman, Incident at Vichy, etc.) here does with his life story what nature does with rock strata, folding it back on itself to achieve the effects of many-layered richness and simultaneity that he aims for in his plays. It's a life as remarkable for its commitment as its achievement. Growing up on the edge of Harlem in the '20s and '30s, the son of a successful but semiliterate coat manufacturer, Miller discovered both his vocation and his leftist political convictions during the Depression and the rise of fascism. He achieved a moral victory against McCarthyism in the '50s; and it was under his presidency that PEN went from an ineffectual literary club to a real force for international freedom of expression. While covering these events, Miller traces the genesis of his plays in his life experience, provides vivid portraits of a host of notables in the worlds of theater, cinema and politics, including Elia Kazan, Lee and Paula Strasberg, John Huston, Clark Gable, Sir Laurence Olivier, John F. Kennedy and Mikhail Gorbachev, and a detailed, deeply touching one of his second wife, Marilyn Monroe, who finally slipped from his reach. Tough, compassionate, bristling with intelligence and profound reflections on the dramas of life and stage, this is one of the memorable autobiographies of our time. Photos.

Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the "spice of spices." Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. <p> The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah. His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. </p><p> <i>Dune</i> is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so.

These pieces evoke a feeling of place that permeates the reader's senses.

Across the roulette table she studied him. He was young; yes, younger than she preferred. One wondered if he yet shaved. The pink blush of innocence still tinged the pretty Englishman's cheeks, and his bones were as delicately carved as her own.<br><br>But he was not innocent. And if he were delicate, well, <i>tant pis.</i><br><br>The croupier leaned over the table. "<i>Mesdames and messieurs,</i>" he said in his bad French accent, "<i>faites vos jeux, s'il vous plait!</i>"<br><br>She waved away the smoke from a nearby cheroot and placed a corner bet, pushing three chips across the baize with a perfectly manicured fingertip. Just then, the gentleman between them rose, scraping up his winnings as he went. An exchange of backslapping and bonhomie followed. <i>Bien.</i> The young man was alone now. In the dim light, she partially lifted the black veil which obscured her eyes, and shot him a look of frank interest. He shoved a stack of chips onto black twenty-two, and returned the stare, one brow lightly lifting.<br><br>"No more bets," the croupier intoned. "<i>Les jeux sont faits!</i>" In one elegant motion, he spun the tray and flicked the ball. It leapt and clattered merrily, punctuating the drone of conversation. Then it went <i>crack! clickity-clack!</i> and bounced into black twenty-two.<br><br>The croupier pushed out his winnings before the wheel stopped. The Englishman collected them and moved to her end of the table.<br><br>"<i>Bonsoir,</i>" she murmured throatily. "Black has been very good to you this night, <i>monsieur.</i>"<br><br>His pale blue eyes ran down her black dress. "Dare I hope it is the beginning of a trend?"<br><br>She looked at him through the fine mesh and lowered her lashes. "One can always hope, sir."<br><br>The Englishman laughed, showing his tiny white teeth. "I don't think I know you, <i>mademoiselle,</i>" he said. "You are new to Lufton's?"<br><br>She lifted one shoulder. "One gaming salon is much like another, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>"<br><br>His gaze heated. The fool thought she was a Cyprian. Understandable, since she sat alone and unescorted in a den of iniquity. <br><br>"Lord Francis Tenby," he said, extending his hand. "And you are...?" <br><br>"Madame Noire," she answered, bending far forward to place her gloved fingers in his. "It must be fate, must it not?"<br><br>"Ha ha!" His gaze took in her daring d�colletage. "Madame Black, indeed! Tell me, my dear, have you a given name?"<br><br>"Those with whom I'm intimate call me Cerise," she said, the word husky and suggestive.<br><br>"Cerise," echoed the Englishman. "How exotic. What brings you to London, my dear?"<br><br>Again, the lifted shoulder. The coy, sidelong glance. "Such questions!" she said. "We are taking up space at the wheel, sir, and I am quite parched."<br><br>He jerked to his feet at once. "What may I fetch you, ma'am?" he asked. "And may I show you to a quiet corner?"<br><br>"Champagne," she murmured. Then she rose, inclined her head, and went to the table he'd indicated. A corner table. Very private. Very perfect. <br><br>He returned in a trice, a servant on his heels with a tray and two glasses.<br><br>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" she murmured, looking about as the servant departed. "I must have left my reticule at the roulette table. Would you be so kind, my lord?" <br><br>He turned away, and she snapped open her vial. Deftly, she passed it over his glass. The tiny crystals drifted down to greet the effervescing bubbles.<br><br>He returned just as she flicked a quick glance at the watch pinned to the lining of her shawl. Timing was essential. He smiled suggestively, and she lifted her glass to his. "To a new friendship," she murmured, so quietly he had to lean nearer.<br><br>"Indeed! A new friendship." He drank deeply of the champagne, and frowned.<br><br>But he was easily distracted. For the next ten minutes, she laughed her light, tinkling laughter, and said very clever things to Lord Francis Tenby, who hadn't a brain in his beautiful head. <br><br>The usual questions followed. She told her well-practiced lies. The widowhood. The loneliness. The wealthy protector who had brought her here tonight, quarreled with her, then so cruelly abandoned her for another. But <i>c'est la vie,</i> she suggested with another shrug of her shoulders. There were other fish in the sea. <br><br>Of course, she proposed nothing. He did. They always did. And she accepted, flicking another glance at her watch. <i>Twenty minutes.</i> They stood. He lost a little of his color, shook it off, and offered his arm. Her hand on his coat sleeve, they walked out of the hell together, and into the damp, gaslit gloom of St. James. A passing hackney rolled to a stop as if it had been planned. It had.<br><br>Lord Francis gave the driver his address, almost tripping as he followed her in. By the weak light of the carriage lamp, she could see that perspiration already sheened his face. She bent forward, offering him a generous view of her cleavage. "<i>Mon coeur,</i>" she murmured, laying her hand on his pink cheek. "You look unwell."<br><br>"I'm fine," he answered, holding himself erect now with obvious effort. "Jush fine. But I want...I want to see..." He lost his train of thought entirely.<br><br>She slithered out of her silk shawl and leaned even closer. "What, <i>mon cher?</i>" she whispered. "What is it you wish to see?"<br><br>He shook his head as if willing away a fog. "Your...your <i>eyes,</i>" he finally said. "Want to shee your eyes. And face. Your ha -- ha -- <i>hat.</i> Veil. <i>Off.</i>"<br><br>"Ah, that I cannot do," she whispered across the carriage, beginning to peel down her left sleeve. "But I can show you something else, Lord Francis. Tell me, would you like to see my breast?"<br><br>"Breasht?" He leered drunkenly.<br><br>Another inch of fabric eased down. "A bit of it, yes," she answered. "Look this way, Lord Francis. Yes, that's it. Focus, love. Focus. Can you see this?"<br><br>He made the fatal mistake of leaning closer.<br><br>"Tatt...tatt...<i>tattoo?</i>" he said, cocking his head to one side.<br><br>"Back. No, <i>black</i>...angel?" Suddenly, Lord Francis's eyes rolled back in his head, his mouth dropped slack, and his head thudded against the carriage door, leaving him gaping up at her like a dead carp at Billingsgate. <br><br>For his safety, she lifted his chin and pushed him back against the banquette. He flopped limply against the leather as she rifled through his pockets. Purse. Key. Snuffbox -- silver, not gold, blast it. Watch, chain, fob. A letter from his coat pocket. A lover? An enemy? Oh, Lud! She had no time for blackmail! She stuffed it back and plucked instead a sapphire pin from the snowy folds of his cravat. <br><br>Finished, she looked at him in satisfaction. "Oh, I do hope it was good for you, Lord Francis," she murmured. "It certainly was good for me."<br><br>Mouth still open, Lord Francis made a deep, snorking sound in the back of his throat.<br><br>"How gratifying to hear it," she answered. "And I daresay your pretty, pregnant, newly unemployed parlor maid shall soon be gratified, too." <br><br>With that, she dropped her loot into her reticule, thumped twice on the roof of the carriage, then pushed open the door. The cab slowed to take the curve at the corner of Brook Street. The Black Angel leapt out, and melted into the gray gloom of Mayfair. Lord Francis's head bobbled back and forth as the hackney rattled on into the night.<br><br>The Marquess of Devellyn was in a rare fine mood. So fine, he'd been singing "O God Our Help in Ages Past" all the way up Regent Street, despite not knowing the words. So fine, he had the sudden notion to have his coachman set him down near the corner of Golden Square so that he might stroll in the pleasant evening air. At his signal, the glossy black carriage rolled dutifully to a halt. The marquess leapt out, hardly staggering at all.<br><br>"But it's raining now, my lord," his coachman said, peering at him from atop the box.<br><br>The marquess looked down. Wet pavement glistened back. Well. Damned if the old boy wasn't right. "Was it raining, Wittle, when we left Crockford's?" he asked, slurring none of his words, though he was drunk as Davy's sow and wise enough to know it.<br><br>"No, sir," said Wittle. "Just a heavy mist."<br><br>"Hmph!" said Devellyn, tucking his hat brim a tad lower. "Well, fine evening for a walk anyway," he countered. "Sobers a chap up, fresh evening air."<br><br>Wittle leaned down a little farther. "B-But it's morning, my lord," he answered. "Almost six."<br><br>The marquess blinked up at him. "You don't say?" he answered. "Wasn't I to dine with Miss Lederly tonight?"<br><br>Wittle looked at him in some sympathy. "<i>Last</i> night, sir," he said. "And then, I believe, the theater? But you didn't -- or the club didn't..."<br><br>Devellyn scrubbed one hand along his face, feeling a day's worth of bristled beard. "Ah, I see," he finally answered. "Didn't come out when I ought, eh?"<br><br>Wittle shook his head. "No, my lord."<br><br>Devellyn lifted one brow. "Got to drinking, did I? And playing at hazard?"<br><br>The coachman's face remained impassive. "There was a lady involved, I believe, sir."<br><br><i>A lady?</i> Oh, yes. He remembered now. A delicious, big-breasted blonde. And definitely <i>not</i> a lady. He wondered if she'd been any good. Hell, he wondered if <i>he'd</i> been any good. Probably not. And he didn't give a damn, really. But the theater? Christ, Camelia was going to kill him this time.<br><br>He rolled his big shoulders restlessly beneath his greatcoat and looked up at Wittle. "Well, I'm going to walk to Bedford Place," he repeated. "Don't need anyone else witnessing my humiliation when I get there, either. You go on back to Duke Street."<br><br>Wittle touched his hat brim. "Take your stick, my lord," he advised. "Soho's rife with footpads." <br><br>Devellyn grinned broadly up at him. "A mere footpad?" he chided. "Taking on the old Devil of Duke Street? Do you really think he'd dare?"<br><br>At that, Wittle smiled wryly. "Not once he'd seen your face, no, sir," he agreed. "Unfortunately, they do tend to strike from behind."<br><br>Devellyn laughed hugely and tipped his hat. "The bloody stick it is, then, you old hen," he agreed, reaching inside to grab it.<br><br>Wittle saluted again, then clicked to his horses. The carriage began to roll. Devellyn tossed his stick into the air with a spin, then gracefully caught it before it hit the ground. Not that drunk, then. The thought oddly cheered him. He set off along the pavement, picking up his hymn again as he hit his stride.<br><br><i>O God, our help in ages past,<br><br>Our hope for years to come!<br><br>Our shel-ter from the de-da-dum,<br><br>And our da-de-da-dum!</i><br><br>No footpad dared accost him on his short stroll through Soho and into Bloomsbury. Perhaps it was his abysmal singing. Or perhaps it was the fact that the marquess was tall and broad, and with his broken nose, not all that inviting. <i>Hulking,</i> he'd heard it said. He didn't give a damn what folks called him. At any rate, he had no need of his stick on his walk. But when he entered the portals of his very own house, still bellowing heartily, things changed.<br><br><i>A thou-sand ages in Thy sight<br><br>Are like an evening gone!<br><br>Short as the something something night!<br><br>Before the de-da-dum!</i><br><br>"<i>You bastard!</i>" The hurtling platter came out of nowhere. "By God, I'll give you an evening gone!"<br><br>The marquess ducked. Porcelain bounced off the lintel and rained down upon his head. "Cammie -- ?" he said, peering into the drawing room.<br><br>His mistress stepped from the shadows, brandishing a fire iron. "Don't <i>Cammie</i> me, you pig!" she growled. She picked up a Meissen figurine and hurled it at his head. <br><br>Devellyn ducked. "Put the fire iron down, Camelia," he said, holding his stick sideways as he walked, as if it might repel the next flying object. "Put it down, I say."<br><br>"Go frig yourself!" she screamed like the Spitalfields shrew she secretly was. "Go rot in hell, you hulking, oversized, ignorant bastard!"<br><br>The marquess made a <i>tsk tsk</i> sound. "Camelia, your limited vocabulary is showing again," he said. "You've bastardized me twice now. Pour us a tot of brandy, my love. We'll work it out." <br><br>"No, you work <i>this</i> out," she said, brandishing the fire iron. "Because I'm going to shove it sideways up your arse, Devellyn."<br><br>The marquess winced. "Cammie, whatever I've done, I'm sorry. Tomorrow, I'll go down to Garrard's and buy you a necklace, I swear it." He turned but an instant to put down his stick and hat. A very bad decision.

"Pig! Pig! Stupid pig!"<br><br>Camelia was nothing if not theatrical. Servants were peering from the passageway now. Devellyn spun around, trying to get a grip on her; but Camelia had him round the neck, trying to throttle him with one arm, while pounding the living hell out of him with the other.<br><br>"Selfish, coldhearted son of a bitch," she cried, hitting him with every syllable.

You promised to <i>be</i> there."<br><br>The marquess slid out of his coat, and his butler crept timidly forward to take it. "I swear I'm sorry, Cammie," he said. "Really, I am. I'll be there next time. I'll come -- why I'll come tonight! Won't that do?"<br><br>Camelia rearranged her skirts and stood with as much grace as she could muster. "No, it won't <i>do,</i>" she said, turning and speaking theatrically over one shoulder. "Because I am leaving you, Devellyn."<br><br>"Leaving me?"<br><br>Camelia strolled to the mantel. "Yes, as in casting you off," she went on. "Throwing you over. Tossing you out of my life. Need I go on?" <br><br>"But Cammie, <i>why?</i>"<br><br>"Because Sir Edmund Sutters made me a very pretty offer tonight." Camelia looked down her nose at him, and the girl from Spitalfields vanished. "Whilst we were all drinking champagne backstage after the play."<br><br>"Backstage?"<br><br>"Where <i>you</i> should have been." <br><br>Camelia was caressing the matching Meissen figurine now, sliding her long, thin fingers over it in a way which he once would have thought erotic, but now looked faintly dangerous. "Of course," she went on, "had you been there, he would not have dared, would he? But you weren't. And so he did." Suddenly, she spun about. "And I accepted, Devellyn. Do you hear me? I <i>accepted.</i>" <br><br>She really meant it this time. What a bloody inconvenience. Oh, there were always other women. He should know. Well, he <i>did</i> know.

Douglas, whom Stevens succeeded, and Stephen Field have served on the Court for a longer time.</p> <p>In <i>Five Chiefs</i>, Justice Stevens captures the inner workings of the Supreme Court via his personal experiences with the five Chief Justices--Fred Vinson, Earl Warren, Warren Burger, William Rehnquist, and John Roberts--that he interacted with. He reminisces of being a law clerk during Vinson's tenure; a practicing lawyer for Warren; a circuit judge and junior justice for Burger; a contemporary colleague of Rehnquist; and a colleague of current Chief Justice John Roberts. Along the way, he will discuss his views of some the most significant cases that have been decided by the Court from Vinson, who became Chief Justice in 1946 when Truman was President, to Roberts, who became Chief Justice in 2005.</p> <p>Packed with interesting anecdotes and stories about the Court, Five Chiefs is an unprecedented and historically significant look at the highest court in the United States.</p></p><p><p>John Paul Stevens served as a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 1970-1975. President Ford nominated him as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and he took his seat December 19, 1975. Justice Stevens retired from the Supreme Court on June 29, 2010.</p>"A gentle memoir by a decent and accomplished public servant. Stevens opts not for jabs or evening scores but rather for reminiscences...Laced with observations on the court's architecture, traditions and even its seating arrangements, it is the collected ruminations of a man who has served his country in war and peace, across the decades... His memoir is as gracious as its author and a reminder that Stevens is more than a longtime member of the nation's highest court. He is a national treasure."&#x2015;<b>Jim Newton</b>, <b><i><em>Los Angeles Times</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>Five Chiefs</i> is a 248-page bow-tie; like its dignified author, and his famous sartorial flourish, an unpretentious but important addition to American history...At its core, the book is not just another memoir from yet another judge. It marks instead the end of an era on the Supreme Court and in the broader swath of American law and politics...Stevens' focused eye gives way to a hundred or so smaller points, some densely legal, some historical, some even funny...<i>Five Chiefs</i> is the right book at the right time.

The title itself is other-directed...And it seems to pain the old-school, bow-tied Stevens that, in order to understand his connection to the chiefs 'some autobiographical comments must be tolerated.' ...

Three decades later, it is the richest and most influential country in Europe, and Margaret Thatcher is the reason. The preternaturally determined Thatcher rose from nothing, seized control of Britain&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Conservative party, and took a sledgehammer to the nation&#x20ac;&#x2122;s postwar socialist consensus. She proved that socialism could be reversed, inspiring a global free-market revolution. Simultaneously exploiting every politically useful aspect of her femininity and defying every conventional expectation of women in power, Thatcher crushed her enemies with a calculated ruthlessness that stunned the British public and without doubt caused immense collateral damage. Ultimately, however, Claire Berlinski agrees with Thatcher: There was no alternative. Berlinski explains what Thatcher did, why it matters, and how she got away with it in</p><p><b>Claire Berlinski</b> received her doctorate in international relations from Oxford University.

She lives in Istanbul, Turkey.<b><i>Globe and Mail</i></b><br>"Claire Berlinski has written a much better book about her than one of those door-stop biographies that are now the destiny of almost every public figure....

She begins with an intuition that Thatcher was a figure of lasting worldwide importance and, more narrowly, one who clearly saw the challenges of her day. She ends with conclusions to the same effect. She makes her journey from hunch to sober appraisal ours as well, leading us back through a fresh look at the issues and personalities as she asks the pertinent and the impertinent questions and challenges the assumptions of the players and their own conclusions about what happened and why.&#x201d;<br><br><b>General Brent Scowcroft, author of <i>America and the World</i></b><br>&#x201c;Claire Berlinski's insight into Margaret Thatcher's character makes this book fascinating, and her intellectual seriousness and rigor make it compelling. It is a perfect marriage of author and subject: Berlinski's Thatcher is painfully real and human, yet simultaneously larger-than-life.&#x201d;<b>Peter Schweizer, author of <i>Reagan&#x2019;s War</i><br></b>"Finally the Iron Lady gets her due. Claire Berlinski brilliantly lays out how Margaret Thatcher's strength and conviction changed the world. Without a Prime Minister Thatcher there might not have been a President Ronald Reagan.

Here, too, are many thoughtful profiles of neglected writers--their works deserving to be rescued from obscurity. Drawing on extensive archival research and interviews with the writers and their families, <i>The Harlem Renaissance and Beyond</i> traces its subjects' contributions to literature, their concerns about race and gender, their common themes, their relationships with artistic contemporaries, and the influence of these early writers on their modern-day counterparts in American literature. </p></p><p><b>Lorraine Elena Roses</b> is Professor of Spanish and Director of Latin American Studies at Wellesley College.Each essay provides insightful biographical information that helps to place the author's writings within the context of the heightened political, economic, and social awareness of the time...Roses and Randolph have secured a place for themselves among black feminist scholars who are 'filling in the gaps' by recovering and reclaiming a body of work that belongs to the 'precursors/foremothers' of more contemporary African American women writers. (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>In the past, reviewers and critics have confined their examinations of the Harlem Renaissance to the literary contributions of male poets and authors such as Langston Hughes and Jean Toomer. However, Lorraine Roses and Ruth Randolph's <i>Harlem Renaissance and Beyond</i> presents a detailed and accessible biographical study of black women writers, active not only during the movement but in the years directly preceding and following its demise. By broadening and revising our understanding of this unique period in literary history, <i>Harlem Renaissance and Beyond</i> exposes the complexity of the political and economical factors which faced women wanting to publish work during this time...Well illustrated with rare archival photographs, the book offers an illuminating literary excavation of work by black women writers who have either been forgotten or marginalised; hence it achieves a timely revision of male-centred analyses of the movement.

Combining the results of cutting-edge work in experimental biology with crystal-clear philosophical arguments, they mount a reasoned and convincing assault on the central tenets of Darwin&#x2019;s account of the origin of species. The logic underlying natural selection is the survival of the fittest under changing environmental pressure. This logic, they argue, is mistaken, and they back up the claim with surprising evidence of what actually happens in nature. This is a rare achievement&#x2014;a concise argument that is likely to make a great deal of difference to a very large subject. <i>What Darwin Got Wrong</i> will be controversial. The authors&#x2019; arguments will reverberate through the scientific world. At the very least they will transform the debate about evolution and move us beyond the false dilemma of being either for natural selection or against science.</p><br></p><p><br><p>Jerry Fodor is a professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers University.<br><br>Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini started his academic career as a biophysicist and molecular biologist and is now a professor of cognitive science at the University of Arizona.</p><br>WHAT DARWIN GOT WRONG<br>PART ONETHE BIOLOGICAL ARGUMENT1WHAT KIND OF THEORY IS THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION?IntroductionThe (neo-)Darwinian theory of evolution (ET) has two distinct but related parts: there's a historical account of the genealogy of species (GS), and there's the theory of natural selection (NS). The main thesis of this book is that NS is irredeemably flawed. However, we have no quarrel to pick with the genealogy of species; it is perfectly possible -in fact, entirely likely-that GS is true even if NS is not. We are thus quite prepared to accept, at least for purposes of the discussion to follow, that most or all species are related by historical descent, perhaps by descent from a common primitive ancestor; and that, as a rule of thumb, the more similar the phenotypes of two species are,1 the less remote is the nearest ancestor that they have in common.2However, although we take it that GS and NS are independent, we do not suppose that they are unconnected. Think of the GS as a tree (or perhaps a bush) that is composed of nodes and paths; each node represents a species, and each species is an ancestor of whatever nodes trace back to it. The questions now arise: How did the taxonomy of species get to be the way that it is? What determines which nodes there are and which paths there are between them? In particular, by what process does an ancestor species differentiate intoits descendants? These are the questions that Darwin's adaptationism purports to answer. The answer it proposes is that if, in the genealogical tree, node A traces back to node B, then species B arose from species A by a process of <i>natural selection</i>, and the path between the nodes corresponds to the operation of that process.We will argue that it is pretty clear that this answer is not right; whatever NS is, it cannot be the mechanism that generates the historical taxonomy of species. Jared Diamond in his introduction to Mayr (2001, p. x) remarks that Darwin didn't just present '... a well-thought-out theory of evolution. Most importantly, he also proposed a theory of causation, the theory of natural selection.' Well, if we're right, that's exactly what Darwin <i>did not</i> do; or, if you prefer, Darwin did propose a causal mechanism for the process of speciation, but he got it wrong.There are certain historical ironies in this because it is the Darwinian genealogy, and <i>not</i> the theory of natural selection, that has been the subject of so much political and theological controversy over the last hundred years or so. To put it crudely, what people who do not like Darwinism have mostly objected to is the implication that there's a baboon in their family tree; more precisely, they do not admit to a (recent) ancestor that they and the baboon have in common. Accordingly, the question doesn't arise for them how the ancestral ape evolved into us on the one hand and baboons on the other. This book is anti-Darwinist, but (to repeat) it is not <i>that</i> kind of anti-Darwinist. It is quite prepared to swallow whole both the baboon and the ancestral ape, but not the thesis that NS is the mechanism of speciation.The argument for the conclusion that there is something wrong with NS is actually quite straightforward; to some extent, it's even familiar. Not, however, from discussions of Darwinism per se, but from issues that arise in such adjacent fields as the metaphysics of reference, the status of biological teleology and, above all, in the psychology of learning. Bringing out the abstract similarity-indeed, identity-of this prima facie heterogeneous collection is a main goal in what follows. But doing so will require a somewhat idiosyncratic exposition of NS.In the first place, we propose to introduce NS in a way that distinguishes between: (1) the theory considered simply as a 'black box' (that is, simply as a function that maps certain sorts of inputs onto certain sorts of outputs); and (2) the account that the theory gives of the mechanisms that compute that function and of the constraints under which the computations operate. This is, as we say, a somewhat eccentric way of cutting up the pie; but it will pay its way later on when we try to make clear what we take to be the trouble with NS.In the second place, we want to develop our exposition of Darwin's account of evolution in parallel with an exposition of B. F. Skinner's theory of learning by operant conditioning (OT). Some of the similarities between the two have been widely noted, not least by Skinner himself.3 But we think, even so, that the strength of the analogy between NS and OT has been seriously underestimated, and that its implications have generally been misunderstood. In fact, the two theories are virtually identical: they propose essentially the same mechanisms to compute essentially similar functions under essentially identical constraints. This raises a question about which prior discussions of NS have been, it seems to us, remarkably reticent: it is pretty generally agreed, these days, that the Skinnerian account of learning is dead beyond resuscitation. So, if it is true that Skinner's theory and Darwin's are variations on the same theme, why aren't the objections that are routinely raised against the former likewise raised against the latter? If nobody believes Skinner any more, why does everybody still believe Darwin? We're going to argue that the position that retains the second but not the first is not stable.Natural selection considered as a black boxAs just remarked, one way to think about NS is as an account of the process that connects ancestral species with their descendants. Another (compatible) way is to think of it is as explaining how the phenotypic properties of populations change over time in response to ecological variables.4 By and large, contemporary discussions of evolution tend to stress the second construal; indeed, it's sometimes saidthat this sort of 'population thinking' was Darwin's most important contribution to biology.5Whether or not that is so, 'population thinking' is convenient for our present purposes; it allows us to construe an evolutionary theory abstractly, as a black box in which the input specifies the distribution of phenotypes at a certain time (the GN [Generation N] distribution, together with the relevant aspects of its ecology), and in which the output specifies the distribution of phenotypes in the next generation (GN+1). This provides a perspective from which the analogies between NS and OT become visible, since OT is also plausibly viewed as a black box that maps a distribution of traits in a population at a time (a creature's behavioural repertoire at that time), together with a specification of relevant environmental variables (viz. the creature's history of reinforcement), onto a succeeding distribution of traits (viz. the creature's behavioural repertoire consequent to training). We therefore propose, in what follows, to indulge in a little 'population thinking' about both NS and OT.Operant conditioning theory considered as a black boxIf we are to think of the Skinnerian theory of learning in this way, we will first have to decide what is to count as a 'psychological trait'. Fortunately, Skinner has an explicit view about this, which, although by no means tenable, will serve quite nicely for the purposes of exposition.Let's stipulate that a creature's 'psychological profile' at a certain time is the set of psychological traits of the creature at that time.6 For Skinner, a psychological trait is paradigmatically a stimulus-response (S-R) association; that is, it is a disposition to perform a token of a certain type of behaviour 'in the presence of' a token of a certain type of environmental event.7 Skinner takes S-R associations to be typically probabilistic, so a creature's psychological profile at a certain time is a distribution of probabilities over a bundle of S-R associations. Correspondingly, OT is a theory about how the distribution of probabilities in a population of S-R connections varies over time as afunction of specified environmental variables (including, notably, 'histories of reinforcement'). The picture is, in effect, that the totality of a creature's dispositions to produce responses to stimuli constitutes its psychological profile. These dispositions compete for strength, and environmental variables determine which dispositions win the competitions; they do so in accordance with the laws of conditioning that OT proposes to specify, and of which the so-called 'law of effect' is the paradigm.We've been describing OT as a kind of 'population thinking' in order to emphasize its similarity to evolutionary theory (ET): both are about how traits in a population change over time in response to environmental variables (<i>ecological</i> variables; see footnote 5). That is, we suppose, a mildly interesting way of looking at things, but if it were all that the ET/OT analogy amounted to, it would warrant only cursory attention. In fact, however, there is quite a lot more to be said. Both theories postulate certain strong constraints (we'll call them 'proprietary' constraints)8 on how the empirical facts about population-to-population mappings are to be explained; and in both cases, the choice among candidate theories relies heavily on the imposition of these constraints.9 Some proprietary constraints derive from (what purport to be) general methodological considerations;10 but many of them are contingent and substantive. They derive from assumptions about the nature of evolution on the one hand and of learning on the other. The substance of the analogy between Darwin's version of evolutionary theory and Skinner's version of learning theory consists, in part, in the fact that the proprietary constraints that they endorse are virtually identical.Proprietary constraints (1): iterativityOT and NS are both formulated so as to apply 'iteratively' in their respective domains. That's to say that psychological profiles are themselves susceptible to further conditioning, and evolved phenotypes are themselves susceptible to further evolution. Iterativity is required in order that OT and ET should acknowledge the open-endednessof their respective domains: ET implies no bounds on the varieties of phenotypes that may be subject to evolution, and OT implies no bounds on the variety of behavioural profiles that may be modified by learning. The effect of this is to permit both theories to begin their explanations <i>in medias res</i>. ET presupposes some presumably very simple unevolved self-replicators with phenotypic traits to which the laws of evolution apply in the first instance; OT presupposes some presumably very simple repertoire of S-R associations to which the putative laws of conditioning apply in the first instance. In both cases, there are serious questions as to exactly what such 'starting assumptions' a theorist ought to endorse. In OT, the usual view is that an organism at birth (or perhaps <i>in utero</i>) is a random source of behaviours. That is, prior to operant learning, any stimulus may evoke any response, although the initial probability that a given stimulus will evoke a given response is generally very small. In ET, a lot depends on what kind of self-replicator evolutionary processes are supposed to have first applied to. Whatever it was, if it was <i>ipso facto</i> subject to evolution, it must have been a generator of heritable phenotypes, some of which were more fit than others in the environmental conditions that obtained.Proprietary constraints (2): environmentalismWhat phenotypes there can be is presumably determined by (among other things) what genotypes there can be; and what is genotypically possible is constrained by what is possible at 'lower' levels of organization: physiological, genetic, biochemical or whatever. Likewise for the effects of physiological (and particularly neurological) variables on psychological phenomena. It is, however, characteristic of both ET and OT largely to abstract from the effects of such endogenous variables, claiming that the phenomena of evolution on the one hand and of psychology on the other are very largely the effects of environmental causes.A striking consequence of this assumption is that, to a first approximation, the laws of psychology and of evolution are both supposedto hold very broadly across the phylogenetic continuum, abstracting both from differences among individuals and from differences among species. (In the darkest days of conditioning theory, one psychologist claimed that, if we had a really adequate theory of learning, we could use it to teach English to worms. Happily, however, he later recovered.) Likewise, it is characteristic of evolutionary biologists to claim that the same laws of selection that shape the phenotypes of relatively simple creatures such as protozoa also shape the phenotypes of very complex creatures such as primates. It's clearly an empirical issue whether, or to what extent, such environmentalist claims are true in either case. It turned out that OT greatly underestimated the role of endogenous structures in psychological explanation; much of the 'cognitive science' approach to psychology has been an attempt to develop alternatives to OT's radical environmentalism. In Part one we will consider a number of recent findings in biology that suggest that analogous revisions may be required in the case of ET.11Proprietary constraints (3): gradualismET purports to specify causal laws that govern transitions from the census of phenotypes in an ancestral population to the census of phenotypes in its successor generation. Likewise, OT purports to specify causal laws that connect a creature's psychological profile at a given time with its succeeding psychological profile. In principle, it is perfectly possible that such laws might tolerate radical discontinuities between successive stages; gradualism amounts to the empirical claim that, as a matter of fact, they do not. This implies, in the case of ET, that even speciation is a process in which phenotypes alter gradually, in response to selection pressure.12 'Saltations' (large jumps from a phenotype to its immediate successor) perhaps occur from time to time; but they are held to be sufficiently infrequent that theories of evolution can generally ignore them.13 In OT, gradualism implies that learning curves are generally smooth functions of histories of reinforcement. Learning consists of a gradual increment of the strength of S-R associations and not, for example, in suddeninsights into the character of environmental contingencies. Strictly speaking, according to OT, there is no such thing as problem solving; there is only the gradual accommodation of a creature's behaviours and behavioural dispositions to regularities in its environment.In neither learning nor evolution is the claim for gradualism self-evidently true. Apparent discontinuities in the fossil record were a cause of considerable worry to Darwin himself, and there continues to be a tug-of-war about how they ought to be interpreted: evolutionary biologists may see fortuitous geological artefacts where palaeontologists see bona fide evidence that evolution sometimes proceeds in jumps (Eldredge, 1996). Likewise, a still robust tradition in developmental psychology postulates a more-or-less fixed sequence of cognitive 'stages', each with its distinctive modes of conceptualization and correspondingly distinctive capacities for problem solving.

No, he would have to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discover, as best one might, what diversions there were in this windy northern city, far from Seressa&#x2019;s canals, where songs of love drifted in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; torchlit night and men and women, cloaked against evening&#x2019;s damp, and sometimes masked, went about hidden from inquisitive eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orso Faleri was willing to simulate an interest in discussing the nature of the soul with the emperor&#x2019;s philosophers, or listen as some alchemist,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stroking his singed beard, explained his search for arcane secrets of transmuting metal&#x2014;but only to a point, surely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he performed his tasks, both public and secret, badly it would be noted back home, with consequences. If he did well he might be left here for two<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years! It was an appalling circumstance for a civilized man with skills in commerce and a magnificent woman left behind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, the Osmanli triple obeisance. To be done twice. Good men, thought Faleri, suffered for the follies of royalty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, this post was vitally important, and he knew it. In the world they inhabited, good relations with the emperor in Obravic were<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critical. Disagreements were acceptable, but open conflict could be ruinous for trade, and trade was what Seressa was about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Seressinis, the idea of peace, with open, unthreatened commerce, was the most important thing in the god&#x2019;s created world. It mattered more<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (though this would never actually be <i>said </i>) than diligent attention to the doctrines of Jad as voiced by the sun god&#x2019;s clerics. Seressa<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traded, extensively, with the unbelieving Osmanlis in the east&#x2014;and did so whatever High Patriarchs might say or demand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patriarchs came and went in Rhodias, thundering wrath in their echoing palace or cajoling like courtesans for a holy war and the need to regain lost<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarantium from the Osmanlis and their Asharite faith. That was a Patriarch&#x2019;s task. No one begrudged it. But for Seressa those god-denying Osmanlis<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offered some of the richest markets on earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faleri knew it well. He was a merchant, son and grandson of merchants. His family&#x2019;s palace on the Great Canal had been built and expanded and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sumptuously furnished with the profits of trading east. Grain at the beginning, then jewels, spices, silk, alum,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lapis lazuli. Whatever was needed in the west, or desired. The caressing silks his wife and daughters wore (and his mistress, more appealingly) arrived<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the lagoon on galleys and roundships voyaging to and from the ports of the Asharites.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grand khalif liked trade, too. He had his palaces and gardens to attend to, and an expensive army. He might make war on the emperor&#x2019;s lands and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fortresses where the shifting borders lay, and Rodolfo might be forced to spend sums he didn&#x2019;t have in bolstering defences there, but Seressa and its<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merchant fleet didn&#x2019;t want any part of that conflict: they needed peace more than anything.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which meant that Signore Orso Faleri was here with missions to accomplish and assessments to make and send home in coded messages, even while filled<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with longings and memories that had little to do with politics or gaunt philosophers in a northern city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first priority, precisely set forth by the Council of Twelve, had to do with the savage, loathed, <i>humiliating </i>pirates in their walled town<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Senjan. It happened to be a matter dear to Faleri&#x2019;s own merchant heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also desperately delicate. The Senjani were subjects, extremely loyal subjects, of Emperor Rodolfo. They were&#x2014;the emperor&#x2019;s phrase had been<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; widely quoted&#x2014;his <i>brave heroes of the borderland</i>. They raided Asharite villages and farms inland and opposed counter-raids, defending Jaddites<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they could. They were, in essence, fierce (unpaid) soldiers of the emperor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Seressa wanted them destroyed like poisonous snakes, scorpions, spiders, whatever you chose to call them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wanted them wiped out, their walls destroyed, boats burned, the raiders hanged, chopped to pieces, killed one by one or in a battle, burned on a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great pyre seen for miles, or left out for the animals. Seressa didn&#x2019;t care. Dead was enough, chained as galley slaves would do. Would maybe even be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better&#x2014;you never had enough slaves for the fleet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a vexed issue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how aggressively Seressa patrolled, how many war galleys they sent out, how carefully they escorted merchant ships, the Senjani raiders found<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways to board some of them in the long, narrow Seressini Sea. It was impossible to completely defend against them. They raided in all seasons, all<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weather. Some said they could <i>control </i>the weather, that their women did so with enchantments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One small town, perhaps two or three hundred fighting men inside its walls at any given time&#x2014;and oh, the havoc they wreaked in their boats!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complaints came to Obravic <i>and </i>to Seressa, endlessly, from the khalif and his grand vizier. <i>How</i>, the Asharites asked in graceful<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phrases, could they continue to trade with Seressa if their people and goods were subject to savage piracy? What was the worth of Seressini assurances<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of safety in the sea they proudly named for themselves?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, some of the letters queried, perhaps Seressa was secretly <i>pleased </i>when Osmanli merchants, pious followers of the teachings of Ashar,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were seized by the Senjani for ransom, or worse?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was, the Council of Twelve had impressed upon Faleri, his foremost task this autumn and winter. He was to induce a distractible, erratic emperor to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surrender a town of raiders to Seressa&#x2019;s fury.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodolfo needed to understand that Senjan didn&#x2019;t <i>only </i>raid over the mountains against godless infidels or seize their goods on ships. No! They<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rowed or sailed south along their jagged coastline to Seressini-governed towns. They went even farther south, to that upstart marine republic of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dubrava (the Seressinis had issues with them, too).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those towns and cities were Jaddite, the emperor knew it! In them dwelled devout worshippers of the god. These people and their goods were not to be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; targets! The Senjani were <i>pirates</i>, not heroes. They boarded honest merchant ships making their way to sell and buy in Seressa, queen of all<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jad&#x2019;s cities, bringing it wealth. So much wealth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vile, dissembling raiders claimed that they only took goods belonging to Asharites, but that was&#x2014;everyone knew it!&#x2014;a pose, a pretense, a bad, black<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joke. Their piety was a mask.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Seressinis knew all about masks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faleri himself had lost three cargoes (silk, pepper, alum) in two years to the Senjani. He wasn&#x2019;t any worshipper of the Asharite stars or the two<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindath moons! He was as good a Jaddite as the emperor. (Maybe a better one, if one considered Rodolfo&#x2019;s alchemy.)

An Aborigine artist, a Holocaust survivor, a beatific washerwoman, and a childlike heiress are each blessed&#x2014;and stricken&#x2014;with visionary experiences that may or may not allow them to transcend the machinations of their fellow men. Tender and lacerating, pure and profane, subtle and sweeping, <i>Riders in the Chariot</i> is one of the Nobel Prize winner's boldest books.</p><p>Patrick White (1912-1990) was born in London and traveled to Sydney with his Australian parents six months later. White was a solitary, precocious, asthmatic child and at thirteen was sent to an English boarding school, a miserable experience. At eighteen he returned to Australia and worked as a jackaroo on an isolated sheep station. Two years later, he went up to Cambridge, settling afterwards in London, where he published his first two books. White joined the&nbsp;RAF&nbsp;in 1940 and served as an intelligence officer in the Middle East. At war&#x2019;s end, he and his partner, Manoly Lascaris, bought an old house in a Sydney suburb, where they lived with their four Schnauzers. For the next eighteen years, the two men farmed their six acres while White worked on some of his finest novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Tree of Man</i>(1955),&nbsp;<i>Voss</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Riders in the Chariot</i>&nbsp;(1961). When he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1973, he did not attend the ceremony but, with his takings and some of his own money, created an award to help older writers who hadn&#x2019;t received their due: the first recipient was Christina Stead. Late in life, when asked for a list of his loves, White responded: &#x201c;Silence, the company of friends, unexpected honesty, reading, going to the pictures, dreams, uncluttered landscapes, city streets, faces, good food, cooking small meals, whisky, sex, pugs, the thought of an Australian republic, my ashes floating off at last.&#x201d;<br><br>David Malouf is a novelist and poet.

Hormonal changes fundamentally impact not only the female body but also the brain and mind. For many women, menopause can become a time when they become vulnerable to mental health issues. Although approximately fifty per cent of the population experiences menopause, there is no general conversation, awareness or acceptance of this natural passage in life. It is vital to get through the quiet that surrounds menopause. By discussing the process, this book aims to reduce the potential for negative impact, build understanding and compassion, and significantly improve the mental and physical wellbeing of women.</p><p></p><h2>Late Innings</h2><p>This Excerpt was taken from the foreward:<p> THIS BOOK IS ABOUT BASEBALL GAMES AND PLAYERS AND seasons that I watched from the spring of 1977 to the late summer of 1981, and also about the substrata of the sport---money, celebrity, power, traditions, and social change---that lie beneath its green and ordered fields. Most of the autumn chapters include a summary of the campaigns just past, but readers are advised not to take these as history. Many deserving ball teams and outstanding players have been slighted in these pages, because I did not see them play over an extended span of games, and other clubs and stars reappear so frequently as to suggest some bias at work. I admit to the charge. I am still a baseball fan as well as a baseball writer, and old fans like to retrace their steps; I like to be in Scottsdale and St. Petersburg in March, in Fenway Park in July (September there hurts too much), at Shea whenever the Mets appear to be breathing, and in Yankee Stadium or Chavez Ravine or walking over he bridge across the Allegheny to Three Rivers Stadium in October. I take sides during most games and through every summer, and although this disqualifies me as a Gibbon, it has probably kept me cheerful. As Bill Veeck always says, it's meant to be fun.</p><p> Some readers may hear a somber, almost funereal murmur in this book's title. This is not intended, for although big-league baseball is long past its innocent youth and well into what appears to be a disordered and self-destructive sort of middle age, it is a flushed and vigorous reprobate, with astounding recuperative powers. I suggest two lighter alternative readings---"Late" as in the late news: the baseball news of recent years; or, perhaps better, the later, most absorbing innings of a good game, when we in the stands begin to understand its particular pace and patterns, and even to pick up some glimmering of its resolution.</p></p><p></p><h2>New in Chess: Yearbook 1, 1984a</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>Joni Sternbach: Surf Site Tin Type</h2><p><i>Surf Site Tin Type</i> is an homage to a sport, a way of life, and a tribute to the people who practice it. Over the past decade Brooklyn-based photographer Joni Sternbach has traveled around the world, creating tintype portraits of contemporary surfers using the nineteenth-century wet-plate collodion process. Stunning in their detail, these one-of-a-kind images evoke the romance and adventure of surfing, and the bold individualism of the men and women who live to ride the waves. Working with a large-format camera and using hand-poured plates that are prepared and developed on location, Sternbach has profiled a fascinating range of surfers, both well known and unknown, on prized surfing beaches. Locations include Montauk and Malibu in the United States, Byron Bay in Australia and Cornwall in England. Typical surfing photographs are action shots, riding the mighty wave and in vivid color, whereas Sternbach turns to a historic technique to capture something essential and even primordial in the portraits and settings, recalling a tradition of nineteenth-century anthropological photography. <i>Surf Site Tin Type</i> features texts by noted photo critic and historian Lyle Rexer, curator April M. Watson, and Chris Malloy and Johnny Abegg, both well-known surfers and filmmakers.</p><p>Like surfing, Sternbach&#x2019;s work is unique and performative.

(The Editors <i>Tory Daily</i>)</p><h2>Conquistadors</h2><p>Following in the footsteps of the greatest Spanish adventurers, Michael Wood retraces the path of the conquistadors from Amazonia to Lake Titicaca, and from the deserts of North Mexico to the heights of Machu Picchu. As he travels the same routes as Hern�n Cort�s, and Francisco and Gonzalo Pizarro, Wood describes the dramatic events that accompanied the epic sixteenth-century Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires. He also follows parts of Orellana's extraordinary voyage of discovery down the Amazon and of Cabeza de Vaca's arduous journey across America to the Pacific. Few stories in history match these conquests for sheer drama, endurance, and distances covered, and Wood's gripping narrative brings them fully to life.<br><br>Wood reconstructs both sides of the conquest, drawing from sources such as Bernal Diaz's eyewitness account, Cort�s's own letters, and the Aztec texts recorded not long after the fall of Mexico. Wood's evocative story of his own journey makes a compelling connection with the sixteenth-century world as he relates the present-day customs, rituals, and oral traditions of the people he meets. He offers powerful descriptions of the rivers, mountains, and ruins he encounters on his trip, comparing what he has seen and experienced with the historical record. A wealth of stunning photographs support the text, drawing the reader closer to the land and its people.<br><br>As well as being one of the pivotal events in history, the Spanish conquest of the Americas was one of the most cruel and devastating. Wood grapples with the moral legacy of the European invasion and with the implications of an episode in history that swept away civilizations, religions, and ways of life. The stories in <i>Conquistadors </i>are not only of conquest, heroism, and greed, but of changes in the way we see the world, history and civilization, justice and human rights.</p><p>First the Trojan War, then the eras of Alexander the Great and King Arthur. Now, in this companion volume to the BBC/PBS television series, the indefatigable writer-filmmaker Michael Wood turns his lens and pen on the restless, sometimes homicidal men who established Spain's empire in the Americas.<p> "The conquest opened up the world," Wood writes, "marking the beginnings of a globalization which was not only commercial, but also ideological and philosophical, a remaking of mental horizons no less than a redrawing of physical geography." Grand themes all, but Wood is less interested in sweeping statements than in exploring the particular circumstances surrounding the careers of Spain's freebooter-warriors. Following in their footsteps, Wood takes his readers first to the dusty, bleak Spanish province of Estremadura, which gave rise to a remarkable generation of conquerors, hungry for land and wealth and well schooled in the arts of war. One of those men, Hern�n Cort�s, was also schooled in law--or so his contemporaries thought--and he was able to turn a talent for fighting and learned disputation into a great personal fortune made first in Cuba, then in Mexico, which he won not so much with weaponry but with great cunning. Another, Francisco Pizarro--a distant cousin of Cort�s--recruited a semiprivate army to capture the great Inca empire, relying on force more than guile. Wood also follows the paths of Alvar Nu�ez Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco Orellana, accidental wanderers who helped open the interiors of North and South America to conquest. His latter-day, low-tech journeys underscore the difficulties the conquistadors faced in their time, and they help readers appreciate the sheer scale of their often bloody achievements. The story of the conquest, Wood writes, "never wearies in the retelling," and he proves it in this accessible, literate, and lively book. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#34;This is historical narrative of a very high quality. The prose is lucid, the descriptive episodes powerfully drawn. Wood describes fairly and sensitively the vast gulf that separated these Bronze Age [Aztec and Inca] cultures from the Western behemoth that overwhelmed and destroyed them, stressing in particular the near total inability of each society to comprehend the mores and values of the other.&#34;-Gene Brucker, Professor Emeritus of History, University of California, Berkeley</p><h2>SEWING STEP BY STEP (Singer Sewing Reference Library)</h2><p>Sewing instructions</p><p></p><h2>Destroyers</h2><p>From the author of THE FIRST TO LAND, a novel set during the Second World War.

Into this potential trouble spot comes CID superintendent Vachell, looking into Nazi plans. Mixed with the Bund activities are various small local atrocitiesa governess's pigeons decapitated, the paws cut off a pet dog. Soon a local farmer, Karl Munson, former head of the local Bund, is found dead in his pyrethrum-drying shed. Was it murder as his widow claims, or an accident as the doctor and autopsy seem to indicate? Munson had a reputation as a womanizer; he'd made a strong play for Janice West of the farm next door. He also virtually disinherited his wife and children and may have been a blackmailer. The superintendent, who is staying at the West farm, finds himself in a difficult position: he is the guest of prime suspects, and he is falling in love with his host's wife. A bush fire, further bloodshed and a near brush with death lead Vachell to the killer and the hope for a new life.

At the front desk, a small man with a Disney moustache did not bother to look at her portfolio. Instead, he informed her that Disney didn&#39;t hire women. &#34;No women? Not at all?&#34; stammered the aghast artist, who had been used to more egalitarian treatment at EC. The little man replied, &#34;Follow me, I&#39;ll show you.&#34; He led her to a huge room with orderly rows of desks. At each desk was a lamp, and under each lamp was a man in a white shirt, drawing. &#34;See?&#34; said the little man. Severin realized that she didn&#39;t want to work at a place like that, anyway.In her book, Trina Robbins takes us through the world of cartooning from Rose O'Neill's Kewpies and Jackie Ormes' Torchy Brown to Allison Bechdel's Dykes to Watch Out For and Lynn Johnston's For Better or For Worse. It is a world that was, and is still, white male-dominated. Women dealing with any subject outside the realm of family and fashion faced being canceled from prominent newspapers or never syndicated at all. Fortunately, this did not stop them; the wealth of comic strips here range from social commentary to politics. I loved the titles in the table of contents (my favorite is Blond Bombers and Girl Commandos). The samples of highly stylized cartooning art alone are worth your time. Now, when you read the funnies, you can know and appreciate women's place in their evolution. -- <i>From The WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women; review by Amy Fletcher</i></p><h2>COLL STORIES/J.O&#39;HARA</h2><p>A collection of short stories reveals the diversity, insight, and verismilitude of O&#39;Hara&#39;s work as he wrote about Pennsylvania, Hollywood, and New York cafe society</p><p>John O&#x2019;Hara (1905&#x2014;70) received instant acclaim for <b>Appointment in Samarra</b><i>, </i>his first novel, and quickly came to be regarded as one of the most prominent writers in America.

Her work as an illustrator first came to the attention of the Canadian book trade in 1974 with the publication of Susan Musgrave's "Gullband". In 1983, the Porcupine's Quill commissioned Rikki to illustrate an edition of Jorge Luis Borges' "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius".<p>Rikki is the author of three short-story collections, seven books of poetry, and seven novels, including "The Fan-Maker's Inquisition" and "The Jade Cabinet". She is also a painter whose work has been exhibited widely. She currently lives in Denver, Colorado.</p>From illustrator-author Ducornet (The Jade Cabinet, 1993, etc.), nearly 60 stories, some previously published--Iowa Review, Canadian Fiction Magazine, etc.--that resemble a vitrine stuffed with curiosities, grotesqueries, and erotic paraphernalia. Written with great verve and a tirelessly original imagination, these tales, though often quite brilliant in their evocation of an individual sensation or idea, cumulatively pall, if not exhaust. Many only a page or two long, a rare few explore more fully Ducornet's preoccupations with religious hypocrisy, sexual repression, and metamorphosis. In the ``Nipple,'' a middle-aged man whose mother has just died decides to marry but then finds all the comfort he needs in a bachelor-party gift of a baby-bottle; in ``Luggage,'' a grieving widower goes on a shopping spree, then says of his wife that ``by dying you have ripened me and deepened me, and in your own wifely and cunning way you led me to the weekend bag'' that will hold all his new purchases; and in ``Bazar,'' set in North Africa, a repressed homosexual who believes ``his life has no other object but spiritual progress'' tries to forget that he has seduced and murdered a young Arab boy. Other long stories are ``Missy'' (a psychotic little girl enacts the symbolic death of a schoolmate by eviscerating and quartering Gossey, ``a small brown, rabbittish'' toy) and ``Outer Space'' (Boo tries to foresee his disturbed mother's moods yet also lead a normal childhood). Memorable shorter tales include ``The Double''--a woman grows a companion from her own severed feet; ``Parasites''--a madman is obsessed with parasites; and ``Grace''--another woman is consoled by the memory of her hair being plaited. With their relentless emphasis on the bizarre, the nasty, and the surreal, tales that provoke and disturb--but generally remain little more than cleverly executed curiosities. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Here was no simple narrative of a sea voyage, and here was the antithesis of a self-serving Hollywood memoir.</strong></p><p>Sterling Hayden was at the peak of his earning power as a star when he suddenly quit. He walked out on Hollywood, walked out of a shattered marriage, defied the courts, and, broke and an outlaw, set sail with his four children in the schooner <em>Wanderer</em>--bound for the South Seas.</p><p>Long before he was an actor, Hayden was a seaman. He had sailed before the mast and as mate and captain in sailing ships. He had been a Grand Banks fisherman. Then Hollywood offered him a screen test. Pushed to stardom, he became the leading man to one of the screen's most beautiful women, and the money began to flow. With money and fame, however, came a gnawing dissatisfaction with his life.</p><p>His attempt to escape launches this autobiography. It is the candid, sometimes painfully revealing confession of a man who scrutinizes his every self-defeat and self-betrayal in the unblinking light of conscience. It is also the triumph of a complex and contradictory man, still a rebel and a seeker, undefeated by his failure to find himself in love, adventure, drink, or escape to the South Seas.</p><p>It is, as Eugene Burdick said of it, "utterly fascinating, written by a man who has been able to achieve an honesty about himself which is almost unique."</p></p><p>Review: It&#39;s mighty nice of Sheridan House to reprint Wanderer for a new generation. Many may have missed this treasure its first time around in 1963, and its second printing in &#39;77. The author, Hayden, was a hero to many sailors worldwide, as well as to workaday malcontents &#34;living lives of quiet desperation.&#34; His searching autobiography reads like a novel; indeed, in today&#39;s vanilla world, with horizons shrinking for Everyman, Hayden&#39;s story seems a fantasy. Rest assured, it&#39;s not... He thumbed his nose at the movie industry, his ex-wife, and a judge&#39;s order forbidding him to take his children to sea in the ex-pilot schooner Wanderer. He sailed off to Tahiti anyway, deeply in debt, taking his children and a crew of friends. His defiance made big news. It made Hayden a public hero again, for lots of men longed to tell their bosses to shove it. Hayden did it, and it made perfect sense to a lot of us. When his book came out, we rushed to buy it. Our reward was an exceptional tale, especially for sailors."An impressive writer. Like Fitzgerald, Hayden is a romantic.

It is the fiesta &#39;Day of the Dead&#39; in the small Mexican town of Quauhnahuac. In the shadow of the volcano, ragged children beg coins to buy skulls made of chocolate, ugly pariah dogs roam the streets and Geoffrey Firmin - ex-consul, ex-husband, an alcoholic and a ruined man - is living out the last day of his life. Drowning himself in mescal while his former wife and half-brother look on, powerless to help him, the consul has become an enduring tragic figure. As the day wears on, it becomes apparent that Geoffrey must die. It is his only escape from a world he cannot understand. His story, the image of one man&#39;s agonised journey towards Calvary, became a prophetic book for a whole generation. Malcolm Lowry (1909-1957) was born and died in England. Between school and studying English at St Catherine&#39;s College, Cambridge he spent five months at sea as a deckhand, an experience which gave him the material for his first novel, Ultramarine (1933). After marrying in Paris, he moved to New York where he completed In Ballast to the White (1936). Under The Volcano was begun in Hollywood, coloured by a short stay in the Mexico that it describes, and eventually finished in Dollarton, British Columbia. If you enjoyed Under the Volcano, you might like F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s The Beautiful and the Damned, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;A Faustian masterpiece&#39; Anthony Burgess</p><p><p>Geoffrey Firmin, a former British consul, has come to Quauhnahuac, Mexico. His debilitating malaise is drinking, an activity that has overshadowed his life. On the most fateful day of the consul's life&#x2014;the Day of the Dead, 1938&#x2014;his wife, Yvonne, arrives in Quauhnahuac, inspired by a vision of life together away from Mexico and the circumstances that have driven their relationship to the brink of collapse. She is determined to rescue Firmin and their failing marriage, but her mission is further complicated by the presence of Hugh, the consul's half brother, and Jacques, a childhood friend. The events of this one significant day unfold against an unforgettable backdrop of a Mexico at once magical and diabolical.</p><p><em>Under the Volcano</em> remains one of literature's most powerful and lyrical statements on the human condition, and a brilliant portrayal of one man's constant struggle against the elemental forces that threaten to destroy him.</p>Malcolm Lowry (1909 - 1957) was raised in England and died there but lived much of his troubled life semi-nomadically - in New York, Mexico and British Columbia.</p><h2>Death by Fame: A Life of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria</h2><p>A biography of the tragic Austro-Hungarian empress follows the winding, often lonely path that led the daughter of German royalty from a pampered life to an unhappy marriage to Emperor Franz-Josef</p><p>She was the Princess Diana of her day: beautiful, anorexic, trapped in an unhappy marriage and a stifling court routine from which she escaped through constant traveling and charity defiantly lavished on those least acceptable to her in-laws (in this case, the Hungarians and the Irish). But Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837-98) was a Victorian celebrity, not a contemporary one, and though her biographer strives mightily to equate her assassination by an Italian anarchist with Diana's fatal accident while in flight from the paparazzi, "death by fame" is not a very accurate title. Nor do all historians accept Sinclair's contention that Elisabeth's husband, Hapsburg emperor Franz Joseph, infected her with a venereal disease that made him guiltily willing to indulge her every whim. He may simply have loved her despite her obvious mental instability and his equally open infidelities. Whatever its factual wobbles, Sinclair's overheated biography is nonetheless good, tawdry fun for its gossipy portrait of the quarrelsome, overbred, and intermarried royalty of Europe on the eve of its final eclipse. Romantic and kind-hearted--but also hysterically restless and incapable of sustained devotion to anything but horseback riding and obsessive physical exercise--Elisabeth was a fitting empress for the enervated fin de si�cle. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Andrew Sinclair is a novelist, historian, critic, and filmmaker.

By the author of <i>Lyddie. </i></p><p>Katherine Patersonis the renowned author of many classic childrens books, including <em>Bridge to Terabithia</em>; <em>The Great Gilly Hopkins</em>; <em>Lyddie</em>; <em>Jacob Have I Loved</em>; <em>Come Sing, Jimmy Jo</em>; and <em>The Master Puppeteer</em>, among many others. Her work has won two Newbery Medals and a Newbery Honor, two National Book Awards, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, and the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award. She also served a term as the National Ambassador for Childrens Literature. Katherine lives in Vermont.Paterson writes of today's gritty reality in an easily read story about a fourth grader whose father's death has thrown her family out of balance. Momma has moved them to backwater Virginia to live with Daddy's stepmother (``Nurses can always get jobs. They just can't get a lot of money''); Vinnie has lost her home, a best friend, and--because 5-year-old brother Mason hasn't spoken since the funeral--Momma's attention. Grandma, too, is a trial; she buys Vinnie ugly clothes at the Salvation Army and insists on making her teacher an embarrassing Christmas present. Mr. Clayton is Vinnie's one comfort, sensitive to his pupils' troubles and source of unobtrusive gifts--barrettes to hold Vinnie's hair out of her eyes; shoes for Lupe, who only has flip- flops and whose troubles are greater than Vinnie's: her father's in prison for killing her mother (Lupe is sure he's not guilty). Mr. Clayton marries; affection-starved Vinnie feels so betrayed that she slashes his car with her barrette and--in an agony of guilt when Lupe is blamed--lashes out at Mason, who runs away. Repentant, Vinnie goes to look for him, willingly aided by Lupe, whose generosity and plucky survival in the face of local prejudice subtly contrast with Vinnie's unreasoned, more childlike response to her losses. Once again, Paterson sets characters drawn with extraordinary empathy in a story distinguished by its overarching theme. Vinnie is ordinary, fallible; but with the help of Lupe's quietly courageous model of grace--plus the values enduring in her own family--she reclaims her equilibrium. Touching, engrossing, beautifully wrought. (Fiction. 8-12) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

After her death from tuberculosis in France, Mansfield's private writings and letters were edited by her husband, John Middleton Murry, and published in four volumes between 1927 and 1954. Murry, however, took liberties in recasting his wife's journals and notes. He excluded most of the vast mass of material and revised much of what he included, resulting in a distorted image of Mansfield as a passive, ethereal spirit.<p>More than four decades later, the real Mansfield finally emerges in The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks, the first unexpurgated edition of her private writings. Fully and accurately transcribed by editor Margaret Scott, these infrequent diary entries, drafts of letters, introspective notes jotted on scraps of paper, unfinished stories, half-plotted novels, poems, recipes, and shopping lists offer a complete and compelling portrait of a complex woman who was ambitious and at times ruthless, neurotic and sexually voracious, witty and acerbic, fascinated with the minutiae of daily life and obsessed with death.</p></p><p>Katherine Mansfield was a popular New Zealand short-story writer best known for the stories "The Woman at the Shore," "How Pearl Button Was Kidnapped," "The Doll s House," and her twelve-part short story "Prelude," which was inspired by her happy childhood. Although Mansfield initially had her sights set on becoming a professional cellist, her role as editor of the Queen s College newspaper prompted a change to writing. Mansfield s style of writing revolutionized the form of the short story at the time, in that it depicted ordinary life and left the endings open to interpretation, while also raising uncomfortable questions about society and identity. Mansfield died in 1923 after struggling for many years with tuberculosis.<br><br>Scott is National Library research fellow at New Zealand's National Library in Wellington.</p><h2>Quotable Women: A Collection Of Shared Thoughts</h2><p>An intriguing collection of quotations from women of all eras and walks of life, providing wise and witty insights into the joys and sorrows of being a wife, mother, lover, friend, and career person.

At the loveliest time of year (the tourist-free autumn), the contessa summons Urbino from the mudbaths at Abano, where he's treating his gout and fretting about his 40ish age. The contessa, a youthful 60, has gone gaga over vigorous actor-playwright Barone Roberto Casarotto-Re. Just how gaga? She even allows him to smoke in her presence. The barone has received threatening notes accusing him of immorality?much like the hero of his one-man show, writer Gabriele d'Annunzio, who had an older mistress. Urbino hates the barone on sight; the man's nickname, Bobo, sets his teeth on edge. Struggling all the while not to be blinded by jealousy, Urbino deals with another American expatriate and a spa doctor who reeks of sulphur while he uncovers greed and a crime of passion?complicated by a double murder. All ends happily, with the contessa's fortune and her life saved from two men with designs on them. Original characters and a wonderful atmosphere make this an exquisitely subtle mystery. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Venice is the most important character in Sklepowich's fourth Urbino Macintyre mystery set in the canal city. In this outing, the American expatriate Macintyre is asked by his patron, the Contessa da Capo Zendrini, to protect her new friend, Barone Roberto "Bobo" Casarotto-Re from scandal or worse. Bobo, an actor of questionable talent, is the target of a series of threatening, blackmailing letters as he prepares for a one-man show on the life of fascist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio. Urbino must suppress his immediate dislike of the pompous and overly theatrical Bobo in order to fulfill the contessa's request. The fact that the contessa seems to be falling in love with Bobo makes Urbino loathe the actor that much more. Initially, Urbino suspects Bobo of creating the scandal himself to publicize his show, but when the apparent blackmailers turn up dead, and the contessa herself appears threatened, Urbino realizes this is no stunt. Sklepowich is a fine storyteller with an eye for the telling detail, and his affection for his adopted city of Venice makes the entire novel sparkle. <i>George Needham</i></p><h2>The True Dharma Eye: Zen Master Dogen&#39;s Three Hundred Koans</h2><p>When the thirteenth century master Eihei Dogen, one of the most influential thinkers in Zen Buddhism and founder of the Japanese Soto school, returned to Japan after four years of study in China, the fruit of his pilgrimage was recorded in a collection of koans called the <i>Chinese Shobogenzo, </i>also known as <i>Shinji</i> or <i>Mana Shobogenzo</i>. This collection of three hundred main cases was first published in 1766 under the title <i>Shobogenzo Sambyakusoku </i> (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye: Three Hundred Cases), and was known to have provided the raw material for much of Dogen's better known Japanese-language <i>Kana Shobogenzo</i>. <br><br>Dogen's collection of koans may come as a surprise to students of Zen as Dogen and the Soto school are generally known for the practice of <i>shikantaza</i>, or "just sitting," rather than for koan practice. Nevertheless, a careful study of Dogen's work reveals that he did use koans extensively in his writing and teaching, not only in the <i>Kana Shobogenzo</i>, but most of his other works as well. Zen students and scholars will find <i>The True Dharma Eye </i> to be a source of deep insight into the mind of one of the world's greatest religious thinkers, as well as the practice of koan study itself. <br><br>Following the spirit of Dogen's pioneering efforts to carry the dharma across cultural divides, John Daido Loori Roshi, one of the West's most respected Zen teachers, has added his own verses and commentaries to each koan. The resulting volume presents readers with a uniquely contemporary perspective on Dogen's profound teachings and their relevance for twenty-first-century Western practitioners of Zen. <br><br></p><p>Dogen (1200&#x2013;1253) is known as the founder of the Japanese Soto Zen sect.<br><br>John Daido Loori (1931&#x2013;2009) was one of the West's leading Zen masters. He was the founder and spiritual leader of the Mountains and Rivers Order and abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery. His work has been most noted for its unique adaptation of traditional Asian Buddhism into an American context, particularly with regard to the arts, the environment, social action, and the use of modern media as a vehicle of spiritual training and social change. Loori was an award-winning photographer and videographer. His art and wildlife photography formed the core of a unique teaching program that integrated art and wilderness training by cultivating a deep appreciation of the relationship of Zen to our natural environment. He was a dharma heir of the influential Japanese Zen master Taizan Maezumi Roshi and he authored many books.<br><br>Kazuaki Tanahashi, a Japanese-trained calligrapher, is the pioneer of the genre of "one stroke painting" as well as the creator of multicolor&nbsp;<i>enso</i>&nbsp;(Zen circles). His brushwork has been shown in solo exhibitions in galleries, museums, and universities all over the world. Tanahashi has edited several books of Dogen's writings and is also the author of&nbsp;<i>Brush Mind.</i>"We are fortunate to receive this important new translation by Kaz Tanahashi and Daido Loori of Zen Master Dogen's early selection of three hundred koans that formed a basis for his many later koan commentaries. Daido Loori's introduction discussing Dogen's approach counteracts prevalent stereotypes that base all koan practice on later eighteenth-century training systems. Daido Loori's brief remarks and verse comments after each case suggest helpful perspectives for practitioners."&#x2014;Taigen Dan Leighton, co-translator and editor, <i>Dogen's Extensive Record and Dogen's Pure Standards for the Zen Community </i> <br> <br>"What Daido Roshi now does in a remarkable way is to breathe new life into the text by innovatively creating prose and verse comments.

A small, older gentleman, his short almost-white hair was neatly combed, contrasting with the slightly disheveled appearance of his clothes. The sleeves of his dress shirt were rolled up at the elbows, and his red-and-black-striped tie was loosened at the collar. Atop his sharp nose sat a pair of round spectacles that were thick enough to make his clear blue eyes seem huge. <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;This is a very inconvenient time for me,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Just sit right there and be very quiet.&#x201d; Turning quickly, he walked toward a huge hand-carved desk. Settling himself behind it and picking up a stack of papers, he grumbled, &#x201c;As if I don&#x2019;t have enough happening right now.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Confused, David glanced around. He was sitting on a large Persian rug, his back against the wall of an ornate, high-ceilinged room. Directly to his left was the hard-backed mahogany chair that had been indicated by the man who was now intently sorting papers across the room. To his right, a globe stood on a pedestal in front of an unlit fireplace. <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Easing up and into the chair, David said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirsty.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Without looking up, the man replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you something in a bit. For now, please be quiet.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; David asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Look here now.&#x201d; The man cursed as he slammed the stack of papers down on the desk and pointed a finger at David. &#x201c;I politely asked you to be quiet, and I&#x2019;m expecting you to do it. You are in Potsdam, Germany, a suburb of Berlin in a free zone presently controlled by the Red army. It is Tuesday, July 24, 1945.&#x201d; Taking a deep breath and appearing to calm down, he reached for his work again. <p></p> Separating the papers, he said, &#x201c;There now, sit and chew on that for a while.&#x201d;<p></p> David wrinkled his brow. I must be in a hospital, he thought. This is a creepy old place. And if this guy is my doctor, he has a horrible bedside manner. Sitting absolutely still, trying to collect himself, David watched the man at the desk. Why would he tell me I&#x2019;m in Germany? he wondered. And the Red army thing? I must have a head injury. Is this some kind of psychiatric exam? <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> He tugged at the collar of his dark blue sweatshirt. Uncomfortably warm, David noticed a water pitcher and some glasses on a small table near a window directly across the room. He stood up and walked slowly to the water. From the corner of his eye, David saw the man behind the desk briefly glance up, frown, and go back to his work.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David quietly poured a glass of water and, drinking it, looked out the window. He was obviously in a second-floor room of this building or house or whatever it was. Below him, no more than fifty feet away, was the bank of a slow-moving river. There were no people boating, no children playing&#x2014;in fact, he didn&#x2019;t see anyone at all. &#x201c;Something isn&#x2019;t right here,&#x201d; David muttered as a breeze crossed his face and rustled the drapes beside him.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Reaching his arm through the open window, David was almost startled to find that the air was warm and humid. Then he realized what had been bothering him. It was the air itself. The air was warm. Every tree within sight was full of leaves, and the grass in the yard below him was green. In the dead of winter?<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Putting his glass down on the table, David placed his hands on the windowsill and pushed his whole upper body through the opening. Yes, it was hot, he decided, and pulled himself back inside. What kind of place is this? David wondered. Why are the windows open in the first place? As hot as it is, the air conditioning should be running full blast. <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> As he moved back toward his seat, David looked around for a thermostat. There wasn&#x2019;t one that he could see. The only temperature-controlling device was an old heater that someone had put in the fireplace. Not that that heater would do anyone any good, he thought. It&#x2019;s so old, it looks like it could have been made in . . . , David stopped in midstride. In a soft voice, he said aloud, &#x201c;. . . 1945.&#x201d;<p></p> Wheeling suddenly, David faced the man behind the desk. The white-haired gentleman looked up and slowly pushed his work to the side. A slight smile on his thin lips, he leaned back into his chair, crossed his arms, and peered curiously at David. <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David&#x2019;s mind raced furiously. Potsdam . . . Potsdam . . . , he thought. Why is that name so familiar? Then, like a thunderbolt, it came to him. Potsdam, Germany, he remembered from a television documentary, was the site of the famous war conference after which the decision had been made to drop the atomic bomb on Japan during World War II. <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> A shudder passed through his body as David put his hands to his head. Think, think, he commanded himself. Who attended the war conference in Potsdam? It was Churchill, Stalin, and . . . All the breath seemed to go out of David at once as he groped for the chair behind him. Sitting down heavily, he stared at the man in front of him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Harry Truman,&#x201d; he said in a shocked tone.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the man said, &#x201c;I am. Though at the moment I would give anything to be almost anyone else.&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Swallowing audibly, David said, &#x201c;They call you &#x2018;Give Em Hell Harry.&#x2019;&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Truman grimaced. &#x201c;I never give anybody hell,&#x201d; he snorted. &#x201c;I just tell the truth, and they think it&#x2019;s hell.&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Removing his glasses, he rubbed his eyes and said, &#x201c;Obviously, I&#x2019;ll not be getting any peace from this point on, so we might as well go ahead and talk.&#x201d; Putting his glasses back on, he rose and came out from behind the desk. &#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;why not you?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; David asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Why . . . not . . . you?&#x201d; Looking directly into David&#x2019;s eyes, he enunciated the words carefully, separating them as if he were speaking to a child. &#x201c;I believe that is the answer to the last question you asked before you arrived.&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David frowned. Trying to remember, he said, &#x201c;I was in an accident, I think.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Truman said, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s sometimes how this happens. And the last question a person asks is often, &#x2018;Why me?&#x2019; Of course, &#x2018;Why me?&#x2019; is a question great men and women have been asking themselves since time began. I know the thought has occurred to me more than once during the past few days. It&#x2019;s hard for me to believe that twenty-five years ago, I was a clerk in a clothing store!&#x201d; Truman extended his hand and pulled David to his feet. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, son?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;David Ponder. Am I okay?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Well, David Ponder, if you mean &#x2018;Am I dead?&#x2019; the answer is no. If you simply mean &#x2018;Am I okay?&#x2019;&#x201d; Truman shrugged, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. I&#x2019;ve never been given any information on how these things turn out.&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Suddenly, David relaxed. Smiling, he said, &#x201c;I understand. I&#x2019;m dreaming, right?&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;Maybe you are,&#x201d; the president said, &#x201c;but, David, I&#x2019;m not. And even if you are dreaming, that&#x2019;s not a problem. For centuries, dreams have been used to communicate instruction and direction to people of purpose&#x2014;great men and women. God used dreams to prepare Joseph for his future as a leader of nations. He gave battle plans to Gideon in a dream. Joan of Arc, Jacob, George Washington, Marie Curie, and the apostle Paul were all guided by their dreams.&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m an ordinary guy,&#x201d; David said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nothing like any of the people you&#x2019;ve mentioned&#x2014;great, I mean&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m certainly no apostle Paul. I&#x2019;m not even sure I believe in God anymore.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Truman smiled as he put a hand on David&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right, son,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He believes in you.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;How can you be certain of that?&#x201d; David asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Truman responded, &#x201c;you wouldn&#x2019;t be here if He didn&#x2019;t. Occasionally, someone is chosen to travel the ages, gathering wisdom for future generations. It&#x2019;s as if the Almighty literally reaches down and places His hand on a shoulder, and in this particular case,&#x201d; the president peered over his glasses, &#x201c;it was your shoulder.&#x201d; <p></p> A sharp knock at the door drew their attention. Without waiting for a response, a large, stocky man strode into the room. It was Fred Canfil, Truman&#x2019;s special bodyguard. Formerly the U.S. marshal from Kansas City, Fred was temporarily attached to the Secret Service and had become a favorite of the president and his family. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to barge in like this, sir,&#x201d; he said as his eyes surveyed the room.&nbsp;&#x201c;I thought I heard you talking to someone.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;No, Fred,&#x201d; Truman said as he looked directly at David, &#x201c;no one here.&#x201d; Then motioning toward the door with his hand, he said, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll see that I&#x2019;m not disturbed?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Of course, Mr. President,&#x201d; Canfil said as he slowly backed out, a concerned look on his face. Still glancing about, he added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be escorting you to the conference room within the hour, but if you need me before then . . .&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be right outside,&#x201d; Truman said as he ushered his bewildered friend from the room, &#x201c;and I won&#x2019;t hesitate to call for you. Thank you, Fred.&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> As the president closed the door, David asked, &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t see me?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Apparently no one can,&#x201d; Truman replied. &#x201c;No one, that is, except the person you came to visit. Of course, that makes me look a little crazy,&#x201d; he said with a grin, &#x201c;in here, all alone, talking to myself.&#x201d; Quickly, he wiped the grin off his face and continued, &#x201c;But I shouldn&#x2019;t think anyone would find it strange. I have ample reason to be talking to myself, what with everything that&#x2019;s going on here.&#x201d; Truman cocked his head and looked at David from the corner of his eye. &#x201c;It is curious how you people always seem to show up during critical points in my life.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;So this has happened to you before?&#x201d; David asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Truman said, &#x201c;three times now since I became president, you being the third. The first time was the night Roosevelt died. I was all alone in the Oval Office, and this kid just appeared out of nowhere. Fred came busting through the door&#x2014;almost gave me a heart attack. It was strange that no one could see him but me.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;The kid?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Yeah, the kid.&#x201d; Truman paused. &#x201c;I say &#x2018;kid.&#x2019; He was a teenager actually. He was having trouble deciding whether or not to finish college.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David was incredulous. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a problem big enough for the president.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;What are you here for?&#x201d; Truman asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; the president said as he moved across the room, &#x201c;at least the kid had a question.&#x201d; Leaning against the desk, he motioned for David to sit in a chair near the globe. &#x201c;Anyway, there was a lot of pressure for him to stay in school.&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;What did you tell him to do?&#x201d; David asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t tell him to do anything,&#x201d; Truman replied. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not my part in all this. I offer perspective. The ultimate outcome of anyone&#x2019;s life is a matter of personal choice.&#x201d; The president continued, &#x201c;I was evidently his second visit. He had just spent an hour or so with Albert Einstein.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David shifted uncomfortably in his seat. &#x201c;Will I be going somewhere after this?&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;Yes, you will,&#x201d; Truman said. &#x201c;Several different places actually, but don&#x2019;t worry. They will be expecting you.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;So you knew I was coming?&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;I was informed as you might expect&#x2014;in a dream&#x2014;the other evening,&#x201d; Truman said. Walking around behind his desk, Truman opened the right top drawer. Removing a folded piece of paper, he handed it to David and said, &#x201c;I was instructed to prepare this for you. This is the essence of why you are here. It is one of the Decisions for Success. This is the first of seven you will receive. You are to keep it with you, reading it twice daily until it is committed to your heart. For only by committing this principle to your heart will you be able to share its value with others.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David started to unfold the page. &#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; the president said as he put his hands over David&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t read it now. You must wait until our meeting is finished. As soon as you read these words, you will immediately travel to your next destination. Amazing, actually. You read the last word and&#x2014;bang!&#x2014;you&#x2019;re gone!&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David reached over and touched the globe, unconsciously turning it to the United States. &#x201c;Do you know my future?&#x201d; he asked.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Truman said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t help you there. And wouldn&#x2019;t if I could. Your future is what you decide it will be. Now you, on the other hand, could probably tell me mine.&#x201d; As David opened his mouth to speak, the president held out his hands as if to ward off the words. &#x201c;Thanks, but no thanks. God knows, there are enough influences coming to bear without you telling me what I already did!&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;You say my future is what I decide it to be,&#x201d; David ventured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I agree with that. My present is certainly not of my making. I worked for years to finally end up with no job, no money, and no prospects.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;David, we are all in situations of our own choosing. Our thinking creates a pathway to success or failure. By disclaiming responsibility for our present, we crush the prospect of an incredible future that might have been ours.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; David said.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;I am saying that outside influences are not responsible for where you are mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, or financially. You have chosen the pathway to your present destination. The responsibility for your situation is yours.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> David stood up. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; he cried angrily. &#x201c;I did a good job at the plant. I could&#x2019;ve taken early retirement, but I stayed. I stayed to help the company remain afloat, and I was fired. It was not . . . my . . . fault!&#x201d; <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;Sit down,&#x201d; Truman said softly. Drawing a chair around to face David, who was trembling with anger and confusion, he said, &#x201c;Look here, son. It is not my desire to upset you, but with the limited time we have been given together, truth will have to stand before tact.&#x201d;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Placing his elbows on his knees, the president leaned forward and took a deep breath. &#x201c;Listen to me now. You are where you are because of your thinking. Your thinking dictates your decisions. Decisions are choices. Years ago, you chose where you would attend college. You chose your course of study. When you graduated with the degree you chose to pursue, you chose the companies to which you would send a r�sum�. After interviewing with the companies that responded, you chose the one for which you would work. Somewhere during that time, you chose to go to a party or a play or a ball game. There, you met a girl whom you chose to marry. Together, you chose to have a family and how large that family would be.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &#x201c;When you chose the house in which you would live and the cars you would ...</p><h2>Calamity Jane (Living Forest Series, Volume 12)</h2><p>Nicknamed the &#34;philosopher of the Forest, Sam Campbell was a writer, photographer, radio personality, promoter, lecturer, and especially a devoted student of living nature.

Only this time the carcass was the Conner family, and no one was quite dead yet.<br><br>Hap Eastman watched from a corner of the Williamsburg Community Church fellowship hall. He&#x2019;d done his part. Started the coffee, laid out the pastries, set up the chairs. It was something he did every Saturday morning for the Women&#x2019;s Aid Society, and every time it was the same. The old girls started with a list of needs and prayer requests and ended with a fullblown gossip session.<br><br>Hap&#x2019;s wife, Doris, was president, and at forty-five the youngest of the group. So Hap hung around tinkering with fixit jobs in the kitchen or perched on a cold metal folding chair in the corner, a cup of fresh brewed French Roast in one hand and a Louis L&#x2019;Amour novel in the other. Four days a week he was a jurist laden with a heavy workload and weighty decision making. Saturdays were his day to relax.<br><br>Hap had already heard the story from Doris and generally when the birds got going, he tried not to listen. But days like this it was nearly impossible.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what anyone says. We need to talk about it.&#x201d; Geraldine Rivers had the floor, and Hap eyed her suspiciously from a distance. Geraldine was a talker from way back and in charge of the social committee. Generally when the gossip got going, Doris and Geraldine fanned the fires and battled for position. Especially in the heated sessions, and Hap figured this was about as hot as they&#x2019;d ever get.<br><br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t read the minutes yet.&#x201d; Louella tilted her face in Geraldine&#x2019;s direction. The minutes were still tucked in her unopened Bible, so her comment was more for appearances than anything else.<br><br>&#x201c;Minutes mean nothing at a time like this!&#x201d; Geraldine nodded toward Doris. &#x201c;Tell us what you know, will you, Dorie? Several of the ladies here haven&#x2019;t heard what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>The vultures nodded in unison, and Doris took her cue.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really very tragic, very sundry. I almost hate to talk about it at church.&#x201d; She paused for effect, smoothing the wrinkles in her polyester dress. &#x201c;You all know the Conner family, Angela and her husband, Buddy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy&#x2019;s been drinking alcohol at the tavern lately. Louella&#x2019;s husband saw his truck there last week, isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d; Geraldine knew this to be true but enjoyed her own voice too much to be silent for long.<br><br>Doris frowned. &#x201c;Right. He&#x2019;s become a regular drunkard. Now, Angela...well, she&#x2019;s another story. A flirtatious type, not given to things of the Lord.&#x201d; She looked around the circle. &#x201c;Nearly everyone in Williamsburg has suspected her of cheating on Buddy.&#x201d;<br><br>The old birds nodded again.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yesterday I got a call from Betty Jean Stevens...you&#x2019;ve probably noticed she&#x2019;s not here today.&#x201d; Doris&#x2019;s face bunched up like it did when Hap forgot to take out the trash. &#x201c;Seems all those rumors were true. Betty Jean found out last week that her husband&#x2019;s been seeing Angela Conner on the side. And I don&#x2019;t mean at the Piggly Wiggly.&#x201d;<br><br>A collective gasp rose from the circle, and six of the girls started talking at once.<br><br>&#x201c;Bill Stevens and that loose woman?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, that hypocrite!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A deacon at Williamsburg Community has committed adultery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll need to make a public apology before I forgive him!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew something was happening between those two!&#x201d;<br><br>The cacophony of accusations grew until Geraldine rapped her fist on the table. &#x201c;Quiet, all of you! Quiet!&#x201d;<br><br>They had obviously forgotten about Hap and his novel, and he gazed at them over the top of his book. The biddies fell silent again, and Geraldine lowered her gaze, trying to look appropriately indignant. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more....&#x201d;<br><br>Doris brought her hands together in a neat fold. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She drew a deep breath. &#x201c;For the past few weeks Bill&#x2019;s been...taking a motel room with the Conner woman. Apparently she set about trying to seduce him for some time. And...well...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a temptress in every town!&#x201d; Geraldine obviously intended to maintain her presence even if it was Doris&#x2019;s story.<br><br>&#x201c;Betty Jean says Bill tried to ward off her advances. But last month...he gave in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do declare, Angela Conner&#x2019;s a harlot. She&#x2019;s always been a whore!&#x201d; Geraldine snapped at a lemon pastry and dabbed fiercely at the filling it left on her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I believe she is.&#x201d; Doris looked glad that Geraldine had said it first. Hap sighed. &#x201c;But the worst part happened last night.&#x201d;<br><br>The birds were nodding their interest, waiting breathlessly for the rest of the story.<br><br>Doris sipped her coffee, and Hap knew she was enjoying the way she held her audience captive. &#x201c;Last night...Bill Stevens ran off with her. The two of them. Just like that, they up and left town.&#x201d;<br><br>Several of the women were on their feet firing questions.<br><br>&#x201c;Where did they go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does anyone else know?&#x201d;<br><br>Doris kept her back stiff, her nose in the air. Hap hated it when she got uppity, and this was one of those times. She answered their questions with all the condemnation she could muster.<br><br>&#x201c;D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The capital?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Betty Jean says Bill sat her down last night and told her they were through. Told her he&#x2019;s in love with Angela, and they&#x2019;re starting a new life in Washington, D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dear heaven, how&#x2019;s Betty Jean handling it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s ashamed, broken. But she saw it coming. About a year ago, Bill began meeting with Angela to talk about a business venture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Business venture?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess we all know what type business&#x2014;&#x201d; Geraldine spat the word the way boys spit watermelon seeds on a summer day&#x2014;&#x201c;that was, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br>Doris hesitated. &#x201c;Betty Jean&#x2019;s just thankful the children are grown and out of the house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Angela Conner was bad blood from the get-go. Last year, I think she was seeing that attorney in town. You know, the divorce lawyer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right. Everyone this side of Richmond knows the Conner woman and how she was always sniffing around for a man to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Hap raised an eyebrow. A man to bed?<br><br>&#x201c;What about Buddy?&#x201d; Again Geraldine was determined tokeep the discussion alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy&#x2019;s disgraced, as well he should be. Any man who can&#x2019;t keep his wife at home should be ashamed of himself.&#x201d; Doris looked at Geraldine for approval. &#x201c;And I have it on good word that he won&#x2019;t be back to Williamsburg Community Church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I certainly hope not.&#x201d; Geraldine finished the pastry and wadded her napkin into a tight ball of crumbs and sticky paper. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s a drunkard.&#x201d;<br><br>There were several nods of approval, then one of the vultures gasped. &#x201c;Oh, dear heaven. What&#x2019;s going to happen to little Jade?&#x201d;<br><br><i>Jade.</i> Hap felt his heart sink. He&#x2019;d forgotten about the sweet ten-year-old, Buddy and Angela&#x2019;s only child.<br><br>Geraldine did nothing to hide her righteous indignation. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she the one who pals around with your Tanner?&#x201d;<br><br>A deep crimson fanned across Doris&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;The Conners live in our neighborhood, in Buddy&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house. Tanner is about the same age as the Conner girl, so it&#x2019;s only natural that the two play together. It doesn&#x2019;t happen often.&#x201d;<br><br>Doris wasn&#x2019;t telling the entire story, and Hap knew why. The reason was an ugly one. He and Dorie had two boys: Harry was twenty and worked for the city dump&#x2014;a detail Dorie never told the girls at the Women&#x2019;s Aid Society. Then there was Tanner. Even at twelve years old, Tanner was everything Harry hadn&#x2019;t been. He was bright and handsome and the finest athlete in primary school. Doris thought he was going to be president of the United States one day. How would it look if he had already made the social mistake of befriending the child of a woman like Angela Conner?<br><br>Of course, there were other reasons Doris detested the children&#x2019;s friendship. More complicated reasons. But Hap didn&#x2019;t want to think about those on a sunny Saturday in May when he was supposed to be relaxing. He shifted positions, but the biddies were too caught up to notice him.</p><h2>Thomas Jefferson (Rookie Biographies)</h2><p><b>Meet Thomas Jefferson!</b><br><br>Fact-filled Rookie Read-About Biographies introduce the youngest readers to influential women and men, both past and present.

Edwards Deming</i></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Foreword</i></p><p>by W. Edwards Deming</p><p>Why is Western industry on the decline? Why has the balance of trade of the United States of America deteriorated year by year for twenty years? The deficit in export of manufactured goods is worse than the overall figures indicate, as export of agricultural products has been on the increase. We have people; we have natural resources, experience. Why the decline?</p><p>The cause of the decline is that management have walked off the job of management, striving instead for dividends and good performance of the price of the company&#x2019;s stock. A better way to serve stockholders would be to stay in business with constant improvement of quality of product and of service, thus to decrease costs, capture markets, provide jobs, and increase dividends.</p><p>In the decade after the War [the Second World War], the rest of the world was devastated. North America was the only source of manufactured products that the rest of the world needed. Almost any system of management will do well in a seller&#x2019;s market. Success in business in North America was confused with ability to manage.</p><p>Management in America (not all) have moved into what I call retroactive management: focus on the end-product&#x2014;look at reports on sales, inventory, quality in and quality out, the annual appraisal of people; start the statistical control of quality and QC-Circles for operations, unfortunately, detached from management&#x2019;s responsibility; apply management by the numbers, management by MBO. [Management By Objective], work standards.</p><p>The follies of the systems of management that thrived in the expanding market that followed the War are now all too obvious. They must now be blasted out, new construction commenced. Patchwork will not suffice.</p><p>Everyone doing his best is not the answer. Everyone <i>is</i> doing his best. It is necessary that people understand the reason for the transformation that is necessary for survival. Moreover, there must be consistency of understanding and of effort. There is no substitute for knowledge.</p><p>A conjurer may pull a rabbit out of a hat, but he cannot pull quality out of a hat.</p><p>The biggest problem that most any company in the Western world faces is not its competitors, nor the Japanese. The biggest problems are self-inflicted, created right at home by management that are off course in the competitive world of today.</p><p>Recognition of the distinction between a stable system and an unstable one is vital for management. The responsibility for improvement of a stable system rests totally on the management. A stable system is one whose performance is predictable. It is reached by removal, one by one, of special causes of trouble, best detected by statistical signal.</p><p>Understanding of a stable system discloses devastation of people wrought by the annual appraisal of performance, futility of management by the numbers, management by MBO. A numerical goal that lies beyond the bounds of capability of a system will not be reached except at the expense of some other activity in the company, thus, in the end, raising total cost to the defeat of the company.</p><p>Teamwork in a company, except for putting out fires, is impossible under the existing annual appraisal of performance. Everybody, once the fire is conquered, goes back to his own life preserver, not to miss a raise in pay.</p><p>It is a pleasure to commend this book by Miss Mary Walton to readers that wish to study her point of view on the theory and examples that guide my work and form the content of my seminars and my book <i>Out of the Crisis</i> (Center for Advanced Engineering Study, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1986). The applications, examples, and comments that she provides will be especially appreciated by her readers.</p><p>Washington</p><p>March 10, 1986</p><p><i>Preface</i></p><p>I first heard of W. Edwards Deming on a trip to Japan several years ago to research a story on workers at Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Inc., which had won contracts to build trolley and subway cars for the Philadelphia mass transit system. It never occurred to me at the time that the American who had taught the Japanese statistical quality control and principles of management after World War II was still living. Indeed, I supposed that he had died shortly after educating the Japanese. Otherwise, he would surely have been famous in this country as well.</p><p>I was therefore surprised to learn in 1984 that Dr. Deming was coming to town. He had been retained by the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce for a four-day seminar in March of that year. I was assigned by my employer, <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, to write a profile.</p><p>Dr. Deming was not only very much alive, but was in rare form when I met him for the first time on January 19, 1984. He was in Philadelphia that morning to give a speech in advance of his March booking, after which his schedule called for an immediate departure for San Diego. I was headed for San Diego as well, to take his seminar there as part of my research. His delightful and protective secretary, Cecelia (&#x201c;Cele&#x201d;) Kilian, had turned down my request to travel with him, and my flight left later than his.</p><p>After the Philadelphia speech, in which he soundly scolded his audience of executives for their poor management practices, Dr. Deming himself invited me to travel with him to San Diego. I quickly changed my plane reservation and off we went. He traveled with only a large briefcase and an inexpensive tan canvas shoulder bag. I remember watching him in the airport as he made a phone call, then pulled a train schedule from his pocket and nearsightedly consulted the pocket-size date book he lived by, jotting down arrangements for an engagement a year hence.</p><p>The Deming profile that appeared on March 11 in the newspaper&#x2019;s Sunday magazine, <i>Inquirer</i>, drew more response than any piece I&#x2019;d written in fifteen years of reporting. People wanted to know how to reach Dr. Deming, where to buy his book, how they could attend the seminar. We ran out of copies of the magazine article and then of reprints as well. When later I proposed doing a book on his method, Dr. Deming replied that he would help in any way he could.</p><p>Over the next year or so, I visited him on weekends at his Washington home near the Maryland line, treading the flagstone path that led past the big holly tree down to the basement entrance of his office. As he sat at his big blond desk, around the corner from the washer and dryer, he was surrounded by a lifetime of books, journals, curios, and awards. If time permitted after we talked&#x2014;or rather, after he talked and I listened&#x2014;there was lunch or dinner with him and sometimes with his wife, Lola, and other guests at his beloved Cosmos Club near Dupont Circle, where popovers and catfish were a specialty. Dr. Deming would order hazelnut ice cream all around, without even asking. Usually he piloted a stately white 1969 Lincoln Continental; its black seats exuded a rich leather smell. Once we took the bus. He was a fan of public transportation. &#x201c;I ride for twenty-five cents,&#x201d; he said with satisfaction in one of the few references he ever made to his advanced age. (During the course of researching the magazine article, I had inquired obliquely whether he was worried about who would carry on his work. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right,&#x201d; he answered tersely.) I found him in all respects to be a kind and thoughtful individual, if occasionally impatient at his student&#x2019;s failure to immediately grasp his conclusions.</p><p>Dr. Deming was good enough to read and comment on many chapters of this book, particularly on those dealing with the Fourteen Points and the Seven Deadly Diseases, and to make available the unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book, <i>Out of the Crisis</i>. He also provided journals of his early trips to Japan. We traveled as well to several of his clients, and he supplied introductions to others.</p><p>The companies that had turned to Dr. Deming&#x2019;s method shared a sense not only of urgency and commitment but also of optimism and excitement. Suddenly, there was a new philosophy that promised answers where none had previously existed. Trained to gather and interpret data, their problem-solving teams were like detectives turned loose with a new sheaf of evidence. At last they had the ammunition to eliminate long-standing glitches in their processes, and they went after them with the enthusiasm of crime-stoppers. Show the slightest interest in their work, and out would come sheets of numbers and stories of misinterpreted clues and, finally, success. Probe a little more into the psyche of the employees, and their stories would bring tears to your eyes: what it meant to be taken seriously rather than to be treated with disdain. To be sought out for one&#x2019;s knowledge and to be asked to contribute to the future of a company. To <i>want</i> to go to work. I heard, too, from executives who had discovered how pleasant it is to share responsibility&#x2014;and to sleep better at night. How good it is to know their employees respect them. And to know that these feelings of satisfaction come at no cost to profits and productivity. Just the opposite&#x2014;their companies were doing better than ever before and saw no end to the improvement.</p><p>These ventures into the American workplace showed clearly that whether the product is hardware or service, whether the company employs two hundred or two hundred thousand, Americans still care about quality. The country is full of intelligent, courageous people who would change if they only knew how.</p><p>In Part Three, Making Deming Work, I sought to report from the factory floor&#x2014;or the office cubicle, as the case might be. I wanted to talk directly to the people involved in the change and to find out exactly what had taken place. I wanted to deal with specifics rather than generalities. Wherever I went, I found the same kinds of problems and the same human reactions. An executive who thinks his or her company is different from the ones in this book&#x2014;who says &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have those problems&#x201d; or &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t happen here&#x201d;&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t really know what&#x2019;s going on, hasn&#x2019;t really talked to the company employees in an atmosphere free of fear.</p><p>By the same token, although evidence presented here of the Deming method&#x2019;s success is anecdotal in nature, to borrow a term from medical research, it would be a mistake to interpret it as atypical. The Deming method will work anywhere. It is universal.</p><p>The question arises, Is America ready? Must we continue the precipitous decline of our value-added economy, living on borrowed time and borrowed money and throwing up protectionist barriers, until we reach the cataclysmic state that more and more experts believe is inevitable? Must it be that only then our businesses and corporations will be prepared to accept a radically different style of management? Or can we act now?</p><p><i>Acknowledgments</i></p><p>Aside from those people whose contributions are evident in the writing, there were several whose keen understanding of the Deming method added significantly to my own. In this regard, I cannot thank the people of GOAL (Growth Opportunity Alliance of Greater Lawrence) enough for their generous help, particularly Director Bob King, for his suggestions, knowledge, and good humor, and statistician Diane Ritter, for holding my hand through histograms and control charts, and for her hospitality as well.</p><p>In Philadelphia, Mary Ann Gould was indispensable. So, too, was Brian Joiner, who gave of his time, insights, and considerable expertise during his trips to the city. At the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, I am grateful to Rick Ross for his encouragement and to Rosalie DiStasio for keeping me abreast of developments.</p><p>Friends helped beyond measure. I thank Peggy Anderson for guidance, Bob Schwabach and Don Drake for general support and expertise with word processors, and Beth Gillin, Jane Marie Glodek, Ellen Karasik, Ron Cole, Bill Eddins, Patsy McGlaughlin, and Jane Barr. For their interest and companionship during the long and vexing newspaper strike when this book was completed, I am grateful to my union colleagues Bill Barry, Kitty Caparella, Rick Tulsky, Lila Roisman, and others on the Newspaper Guild negotiating committee.</p><p>I am also grateful to David Boldt, editor of <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> Sunday magazine, both for assigning the story that led to this book and for a happy, long-standing editor/writer relationship. All the people at the magazine, where I work, were a constant source of good cheer. Sally Downey, his assistant and my friend, was wonderful. My gratitude as well to Dr. Deming&#x2019;s devoted secretary, Cecelia Kilian, who put up with my many calls. Artist Carol Estornell gave both elegance and coherence to the illustrations in this book. Harold Tassell, Jim Naughton and Katherine Hatton gave important advice.</p><p>Finally, my love and thanks to my darling daughter, Sarah, for her patience and understanding; to my father, Joseph Vogel, to my stepmother, Lucia Yu, and to my mother, Mary Vogel, who did not fail me.</p><p><i>PART ONE</i></p><p>W. EDWARDS DEMING&#x2014;THE MAN AND HIS MISSION</p><p><i>Chapter 1</i></p><p>W. Edwards Deming:</p><p><i>A Biographical Note</i></p><p>Born on October 14, 1900, William Edwards Deming is as old as this century. He was sixteen when the United States entered World War I, and forty-one when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He was in his fiftieth year when Japan, its economy staggering from the effects of war, decided it needed the help of a &#x201c;foreign expert,&#x201d; and he was in his eightieth when NBC featured him on a broadcast entitled &#x201c;If Japan Can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why Can&#x2019;t We?&#x201d; and he was, at rather long last, discovered in his homeland.</p><p>He grew up on a Wyoming homestead during the period when irrigation was taming the Wild West and transport was by horse and buggy. His work has taken him to the frontiers of technology. Few have lived through so many important eras in history.</p><p>The son of a man who was trained in the law and a woman who studied music, he is named for them both: His father was William Albert Deming and his mother, Pluma Irene Edwards. From his father he derived a penchant for scholarship; from his mother, who had studied at Oberlin College&#x2019;s conservatory of music, a love of composition.</p><p>In the early 1900s, William Deming, Sr., moved his family from Sioux City, Iowa, to Cody, Wyoming, where he had a business arrangement with an attorney. He and Pluma had two small sons by that time, William and Robert, who was a year younger. Cody had been named for Buffalo Bill&#x2014;William Frederick Cody, the colorful nineteenth-century army scout and buffalo hunter and the organizer in 1883 of &#x201c;Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West Show.&#x201d; The Demings lived in a small house on the grounds of the Irma Hotel, named for Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s daughter, and Buffalo Bill himself would put in frequent appearances. The two boys were entranced by the long-haired, mustachioed blond showman. Robert Deming remembers visiting an aunt in Los Angeles when Buffalo Bill brought his show to town. The aunt and her two charges elbowed their way to the front of the crowd, and Buffalo Bill recognized the two boys from his home...</p></p><h2>Batman Incorporated Vol. 1 Deluxe Edition</h2><p>Batman unites the Dark Knights from around the globe in BATMAN INCORPORATED VOL. 1: THE DELUXE EDTION by superstar writer Grant Morrison!<br><br>Morrison continues his earth-shattering run on the Batman titles with this exciting series illustrated by hot artist&nbsp;Yanick Paquette that features the next stage of evolution of the Dark Knight.

But the Commandments do not always prevent such virtuous scoffers from dealings with their neighbor of which no gentleman could be capable and retain his claim to the title. Though it may require ingenuity to reconcile their actions with the Decalogue�&#x20ac;&#x201d;the ingenuity is always forthcoming. There is no intention in this remark to intimate that there is any higher rule of life than the Ten Commandments; only it is illuminating as showing the relationship between manners and morals, which is too often overlooked. The polished gentleman of sentimental fiction has so long served as the type of smooth and conscienceless depravity that urbanity of demeanor inspires distrust in ruder minds. On the other hand, the blunt, unpolished hero of melodrama and romantic fiction has lifted brusqueness and pushfulness to a pedestal not wholly merited. Consequently, the kinship between conduct that keeps us within the law and conduct that makes civilized life worthy to be called such, deserves to be noted with emphasis. The Chinese sage, Confucius, could not tolerate the suggestion that virtue is in itself enough without politeness, for he viewed them as inseparable and "saw courtesies as coming from the heart," maintaining that "when they are practised with all the heart, a moral elevation ensues."</p><p></p><h2>Getting Stronger: Weight Training for Men and Women (Revised Edition)</h2><p>For the estimated 26 million Americans lifting weights in 1987, here is the most complete book ever published on weight training. Features an easy-to-use format with one-page training programs that can be photocopied. Over 2,000 illustrations, 45 photos.</p><p>YA Pearl offers a comprehensive introduction to weight training. He cautions readers on ways to avoid injury, but the supervision of a coach is still advisable in high-school weight rooms. Beginning with beginners, Pearl provides guidance on how to structure a fitness program and how to increase the level of fitness attained; he also offers discussion on choosing equipment, human musculature, nutrition, and steroids, as well as ``A Brief History of Resistance Exercise'' by Terry Todd. Exercise programs that are appropriate for general bodybuilding are outlined, as well as those for specific sports (aerobic dance, running, basketball, and triathlon), for fine tuning specific parts of the body, and for exercises with free weights and various name brand machines. The carefully drawn illustrations show men and women demonstrating the exercises; students can easily see how to proceed. Given the current enthusiasm for weight training by athletic departments and physical education programs, no high-school library can afford to pass this title by.Dorcas Hand, Episcopal High School, Bellaire<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Pearl, a four-time Mr. Universe, and runner/triathlete/weightlifter Moran here adapt Pearl's self-published Keys to the Inner Universe for a wider audience.

It marks the moment of recognition that the world was becoming increasingly dependent on a modern and commercialized system of communication in which the designer was to play a major role. An unprecedented scale of attention was devoted to printed matter, whether as designs for graphic ornament, typefaces and logos in books and advertisements, or magazines, posters, signage, and exhibitions. Jeremy Aynsley has written the first account in English of the emergence of German graphic design between 1890 and 1945. Based on many years of research and original material, this handsome book is lavishly illustrated with examples from across a stylistically varied field.<br><br>There were many good reasons for Germany to lead in the field of print culture. Historically it was a country that had been associated since the Middle Ages with the arts of the book and printing, and many of the new design developments in the twentieth century grew from that base. The spectacular industrial and commercial boom following the Franco-Prussian War, when the Germans became world competitors, stimulated interest in the field of advertising, whether in newspapers, journals, or on sidewalk kiosks. Perhaps borrowing in the beginning from the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, Art Nouveau in France, and the advanced advertising designers in the U.S., the German artists soon developed a style of their own that was aggressive, aesthetically adventurous, and well constructed to attract customers.<br><br>While some of the individual designers such as Peter Behrens, Lucian Bernhard, Jan Tschichold, Herbert Bayer, and John Heartfield are well known, many others have not received such attention. Aynsley provides an amazingly well-rounded picture of this burst of innovation that changed the face of modern life, as well as of the politically and socially turbulent era that spawned it.</p><p><b>Jeremy Aynsley</b> is Course Director of the History of Design at the Royal College of Art in London."Aynsley's book is a model history. . . .

A Medieval Mystery</h2><p><br>In this spectacular work of historical speculation Terry Jones investigates the mystery surrounding the death of Geoffrey Chaucer over 600 years ago. A diplomat and brother-in-law to John of Gaunt, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom, Chaucer was celebrated as his country's finest living poet, rhetorician and scholar: the preeminent intellectual of his time. And yet nothing is known of his death. In 1400 his name simply disappears from the record. We don't know how he died, where or when; there is no official confirmation of his death and no chronicle mentions it; no notice of his funeral or burial. He left no will and there's nothing to tell us what happened to his estate. He didn't even leave any manuscripts. How could this be? What if he was murdered? <br><br>Terry Jones' hypothesis is the introduction to a reading of Chaucer's writings as evidence that might be held against him, interwoven with a portrait of one of the most turbulent periods in English history, its politics and its personalities.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Terry Jones</b> is the author of several acclaimed works on the Middle Ages including <i>Chaucer's Knight, Crusades</i>, and <i>Medieval Lives</i>, the basis for his popular PBS series.

Situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, on the edge of the inhabitable world, the nation was both isolated and abjectly poor. Centuries of colonisation translated into oppression and subjugation from the colonial overlords, and a hostile climate and repeated natural disasters meant that mere survival was a challenge to even the hardiest of souls. In these 50 miniature essays, Alda Sigmundsdottir writes about the Icelanders in centuries past in a light and humourous way, yet never without admiration and respect for the resilience and strength they showed in coping with conditions of adversity that are barely imaginable today. Their ways of interacting with the natural world are described, as are their sometimes tragic, sometimes ingenious, means of dealing with maltreatment and injustice from the church and other rulers. These forms of oppression include a trade monopoly imposed by Denmark that lasted nearly two centuries, a ban on dancing that lasted for a similar length of time, the forced dissolution of households when the breadwinner of the family died, the tyranny of merchants granted exclusive right to trade with the Icelanders, and the dreaded decrees of the Grand Judgement - a court of law that was set up to punish various offenses, real or imagined. Yet it is not only the &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; that is described in this book, but also the various smaller aspects that shed light on the daily life of the Icelanders of old. These include their ingenious ways of coping with lack, of preserving food, of finding shelter, of creating or admitting light into their homes, as well as the innumerable and sometimes wacky superstitions attached to various life events, big and small. The hilarious customs of hospitality and visiting are also described, as are some of the sexual activates of Icelanders in the past, their belief in elves and hidden people, sexual interactions with hidden people (!), ways of dealing with grief, interactions with foreigners, and much, much more. Today&#x2019;s Iceland is a modern, cosmopolitan place, with one of the highest standards of living in the world. Yet less than a century ago, this paragon of equality and peace was the poorest society in Europe. The conditions of life described in this book are therefore not very distant from the Icelanders today, and many of the aspects described are still very much reflected in Iceland&#x2019;s unique culture. For example, the harsh climate and isolation of the past meant that there was a serious lack of grains for food. Consequently the Icelanders devised ways to make breads and cakes that used very little flour. The Icelandic &#x201c;pancake&#x201d;, similar to a French crepe, is still very much a part of traditional Icelandic celebrations, as is the &#x201c;laufabraud&#x201d; - a wafer-thin, deep-fried bread that is traditionally eaten at Christmas. The Icelandic language is also rich with throwbacks to the past - for instance the Icelandic word for &#x201c;windfall&#x201d; is &#x201c;hvalreki&#x201d; which literally means &#x201c;beached whale&#x201d; - this because a single beached whale in the old days was usually enough to feed an entire district, or one household for a full year, something that was immensely welcome in a country where food was in short supply. In short, The Little Book of the Icelanders in the Old Days is not only a funny, witty and wise expose on the Icelanders&#x2019; daily life in the past, it is also essential to understanding the Icelandic national character today.</p><p>Alda Sigmundsd�ttir is an Icelandic-born writer, journalist, translator and blogger. She is author of The Little Book of the Icelanders, a humorous take on the quirks and foibles of the Icelandic people, and Living Inside the Meltdown, about the effects of Iceland&#39;s financial crash on ordinary citizens. For six years she wrote Iceland&#39;s most popular English-language blog, The Iceland Weather Report, which among other things chronicled Iceland&#39;s economic meltdown and was featured in media all over the world. English is her first language, and she has written extensively about Iceland for the international media.

Franklin (ret.) believes almost everything that he is as an adult can be traced back to his days at West Point, where he was not only a cadet but an instructor, football coach, and eventually Commandant of Cadets. U.S. Military Academy graduates are found at the highest levels in every walk of life: military, education, business, medicine, law, and government. "But," says Franklin, "you don't have to graduate from the U.S. Military Academy to embrace its ideals or to benefit from the wisdom that is taught there. Competent, even inspiring, leadership is within the grasp of nearly everyone." The principles of leadership-including Duty, Honor, Faith, Courage, Perseverance, Confidence, Approachability, Adaptability, Compassion, and Vision-can be internalized and polished to one's own level of expertise and ambition.</p><p>"I have known Joe Franklin, since the late 1970s, when I coached at West Point and he was the Commandant of Cadets. General Joe is well-known by the many people whose lives he has touched as a truly thoughtful, approachable, and compassionate human being. He has written a very readable book using examples drawn from his personal experience to illustrate key principles of leadership, a subject I have studied and practiced for most of my adult life. His simple, honest, easy to understand text is a welcome addition to the references available to leaders, young and old alike. This book will definitely help you become a better leader. The General is one of the best ever!" - Mike "Coach K" Kryzewski, Duke University Basketball Coach</p></p><p><p><strong>Joseph P. Franklin</strong> graduated from West Point in 1955 with a commission in the US Army Corps of Engineers. He earned master's degrees in civil engineering and nuclear engineering from MIT, taught the first nuclear engineering course at West Point, commanded a combat engineer battalion in Vietnam, and worked as executive assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. Franklin was commandant of cadets at West Point from 1979 to 1982. After his promotion to major general, he served as chief of the Joint US Military Group and senior US defense representative in Spain. In 1993 he was elected chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Frequency Electronics and is presently on the board of directors of RKO Pictures, Inc. In 2007, Franklin received West Point's Distinguished Graduate award, noting his outstanding career and fine example of the Academy's <em>Duty, Honor, Country</em> motto. Franklin and his wife, Constance Marie Smith, have four sons and eight grandchildren.</p></p><h2>Blood of Amber</h2><p>Merle Corey escapes from prison into Amber, a world of wonders and confusions where friends and foes are sometimes indistinguishable, where a man is out to kill him and a woman to help him</p><p><p>Roger Zelazny&nbsp;burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for&nbsp;<em>Lord of Light</em>, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular&nbsp;<em>Amber</em>&nbsp;series,&nbsp;<em>Nine Princes in Amber.</em>&nbsp;In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career. He died on June 14, 1995.</p>Some fans of Zelazny's dense, brilliant writings from the '60s have been dismayed at the time and effort he has invested in his Amber series during the past 16 years. If these fantasy adventures are simple and formulaic compared with his best work, they have earned him a whole new audience by virtue of their elegance, humor, literacy, vivid action and lightly applied but complex background of tarot, alternate worlds, Olympian gods, and a magic so neat and clear that computers can learn it. In this seventh installment, the sorcerer Merlin of Amberaka Merle Corey of San Franciscolearns the identities of two would-be assassins but makes a truce with one to pursue the greater, more dangerous power beyond them. Once again, the limited plot is enlivened by Zelazny's irony, his bravura sequences (particularly a harbor visit that turns nasty in Death Alley) and his laconic sense of the incongruous (are magicians the ultimate surrealist artists?).

What remains constant in this complex work is the speaker&#x2019;s ease as she moves from one format and style to another, constructing and deconstructing ideas. That facility is one reason some consider Notley one of our greatest living poets.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2013;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Reading Alice Notley is altogether unlike reading: the pure force of language, instant invention, rapid transformation, and coinage of new archetypes all add up to a more visceral, centrifugal, hallucinatory experience, which is all-absorbing as it is enlightening. &#x201c; <br><b>&#x2013;</b><i><b> The Chicago Tribune</b>&nbsp;<b><br></b></i><br> &#x201c;These are not poems of one world; they are poems of worlds within a world. Each world bears its own stories&#x2014;&#x2018;story&#x2019; being a recurrent term and motif in the book. Among them are resonances of today&#x2019;s dire events and dread conditions, darkening the spirit of the &#x2018;I&#x2019; whose soliloquies register the facts and forms of the worlds, and assesses them.Notley muses in the spirit of Nietzsche but with her own glorious and inspired honesty. No book by Alice Notley is ever less than magnificent, and <i>Certain Magical Acts</i> is exactly that.&#x201d;<br><b>- Lyn Hejinian</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Alice Notley made language surrender its deepest lie: that it matters. Making language do what it no longer has faith in, she restored its power. Language acquiesces to the authority of Notley's speech like a hypnotized leopard, a ferocious and devoted pet who sees itself only as an enactment of the poet's body, which is itself an enactment of a &#x2018;body.&#x2019; Notley owns the magic of the luminous illusion of being here now in the place of enactments. Her work shatters, and always has, any expectation..&#x201d;<br><b>- Andrei Codrescu</b></p><h2>Kerouac: A Biography (Picador Books)</h2><p>Now that Kerouac&#39;s major novel, On the Road is accepted as an American classic, academic critics are slowly beginning to catch up with his experimental literary methods and examine the dozen books comprising what he called &#39;the legend of Duluoz.&#39; Nearly all of his books have been in print internationally since his death in 1969, and his writing has been discovered and enjoyed by new readers throughout the world. Kerouac&#39;s view of the promise of America, the seductive and lovely vision of the beckoning open spaces of our continent, has never been expressed better by subsequent writers, perhaps because Kerouac was our last writer to believe in America&#39;s promise--and essential innocence--as the legacy he would explore in his autobiographical fiction.</p><p><b>Ann Charters</b> received her B.A. at Berkeley and her Ph.D. at Columbia.

Especially useful is the way the author shows Renoir's art in relation to the French Salon and to the other Impressionists. Paintings of the same scene by Renoir and Claude Monet are reproduced on facing pages, and do more to describe the Impressionist style than many paragraphs of text.

He is the author of a book about Robert Kennedy, <i>The Last Patrician</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of 1998. His work has appeared in <i>The Wall Street Journal, National Review,</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>. A graduate of Columbia, Cambridge, and Yale Law School, he is a lawyer, and he lives in Westchester County, New York, with his wife and daughter.While it's hard to imagine that the market needs yet another work on Thomas Jefferson, this thoughtful reflection on our third president's disposition and cast of mind merits company with the best recent works about the man. Beran gives us a Jefferson less rationalistic and intellectual than full of sentiment and tender emotions, a classic 18th-century example of "the man of feeling." Beran's Jefferson finds inspiration not in the philosophy of Locke or Newton but in poetry, beauty and scenery. Beran (The Last Patrician) is most at home with the inward-looking Jefferson, and the book slows when the author has to deal with Jefferson the public figure and politician. But its center of gravity (a quarter of the entire work) is Beran's splendid treatment of Jefferson's nine-month grand tour of Europe, 1786-1787. The author follows his subject through France and Italy, evokes the natural and historic landscape, and reports to great effect Jefferson's views of what he saw and how he felt. For all this, Beran strains credulity by making Jefferson out to be someone who invented himself. (Surely Ben Franklin is the model for that!) Yet the work's great value is to remind us that Jefferson was as much affected by mysteries of the unknown and fears for himself and mankind as he was the optimist who steered his bark "with Hope in the head, leaving Fear astern"-the Jefferson we're acquainted with. While this is not new knowledge, it's good to be reminded of it, and Beran has done that with style and success. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Puzzle Farm (Usborne Young Puzzle Books)</h2><p>-- Entertaining stories filled with lots of fun picture-puzzles<p>-- Large pages with full-color cartoon style artwork coupled with exciting, fantastical adventures</p></p><p></p><h2>Silver Spoon</h2><p>This is a hardcover book from 1997. It does not have the paper cover. There are two superficial tears on the lower spine of the book,1cm long each. A couple of grease marks on the back. No stains inside.</p><p>First published in 1950 and revised over time, Italy's bestselling culinary "bible," <i>Il Cucchiaio d'argento</i>, is now available in English. <i>The Silver Spoon</i> boasts over 2,000 recipes and arrives in a handsome (and weighty) photo-illustrated edition complete with two ribbon markers. Its chapters make every menu stop from sauces and antipasti through cheese dishes and sweets, with many standout dishes like Genoese Pesto Minestrone, Eggplant and Ricotta Lasagna, Pork Shoulder with Prunes, and Chocolate and Pear Tart; the book also includes a number of "eccentricities," like sections on patty shells and bean sprouts, surely not an Italian dining staple. Meant to be inclusive, the book also offers a wide range of non-Italian, mostly French formulas, supplemented by a few "exotic" and other non-traditional entries. <p> Though the recipe range is vast, it must be said that American readers, anxious to cook this authentic fare, will encounter problems. Translating a cookbook from one language to another requires cultural recasting as well as word substitution, and in this the book's editors have been lax. The problems include non-idiomatic usages, for example, calling for "pans" when "pots" is needed; awkward conversions from the metric system, resulting in requirements like eleven ounces of zite; and the inclusion of ingredients like cavolo nero (Tuscan cabbage), tope (a Mediterranean fish), and pancetta copatta (ham-stuffed pancetta) that are unavailable here and for which no alternatives are suggested. In addition, the recipes themselves are often insufficiently specific or detailed--even seasoned bakers will pause before cake recipes that don't specify pan size--and can also lack yields. Space considerations have also meant printing recipes in single, one-column paragraphs, which can make place-finding while cooking difficult, and there are typos and other goofs (one recipe for four specifies six cups of sliced scallions; another requires that a marinade be "stirred frequently for five to twelve hours"). </p><p> All this said, many cooks--casual and serious alike--as well as cookbook collectors, will want <i>The Silver Spoon</i>. It's an essential document of the Italian table and as such a classic. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a complete cookbook library without the book--a welcome evocation of a much-beloved repertoire by those who know it best. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>&#39;Its simple style and authenticity will appeal to both the gourmet and the occasional cook.&#39; (What&#39;s On In London) &#39;I predict this is going to become the new bible on Italian food.&#39; (The Bookseller) &#39;The Italians have kept their culinary secrets to themselves for too long - The Silver Spoon gives the rest of us a chance to get your hands on them.

William Trevor, himself a distinguished short story writer, brings a special sensibility and awareness to his role as editor as he presents stories by Maria Edgeworth, Elizabeth Bowen, Liam O'Flaherty and such modern rising stars as Edna O'Brian, Desmond Hogan, and Joyce Cary. This wide-ranging collection of forty-five stories will certainly serve to entertain and enrich our understanding of this unique literary genre.</p><p><br><strong>William Trevor</strong> was born in Mitchelstown, County Cork in 1928 and spent his childhood in provincial Ireland. He attended a number of Irish schools and later Trinity College, Dublin. He is a member of the Irish Academy of Letters and was awarded an honorary CBE in 1977 in recognition of his services to literature. His most recent publication is 'The Hill Bachelors' (2000), and his other books include 'The Ballroom of Romance' (1972), 'Angels at the Ritz' (1975, Royal Society of Literature Award), 'Children of Dynmouth' (1976, Whitbread Award), 'Other People's Worlds' (1980), and 'The News From Ireland' (1986).<br>The short story, unlike the novel, is rooted in an oral tradition. Perhaps this explains its popularity and prominence in Ireland, where people have always delighted in the spoken word. From the magical folk tales and fairy stories, seven of which are given here, to classics like Joyce's "The Dead" and O'Connor's "Guests of the Nation," Trevor admirably suggests the variety as well as the continuity of this tradition. Seumus O'Keely's poignantly comic "The Weaver's Grave," about two elderly men's personal battle to remember the last free space in an ancient burial ground, is a turning point, mixing a modern sensibility with antique form. The modern story, which often portrays the brutality, repression, and disappointment characteristic of Irish life, is keenly represented by Mary Lavin's "Sarah." Trevor has chosen well. Bitter Harvest , which supplements Montague's The Book of Irish Verse (Macmillan, 1974; Peter Smith, 1984. reprint), a collection of verse from earliest times to the Irish Renaissance, is not quite as successful. The contemporary poets represented here write against the backdrop of political turmoil, but the verse, less thematically homogeneous than Montague would make us think, reels more from Yeats's powerful influence than from explosives. Included are so many poets who have just started their careers that one might wait on this collection to see if all the fruits of Ireland's "bitter harvest" are really worth saving.<br><i>- Donald P.

As a student and young researcher in the 1980s, Gelernter hoped to build a program with a dial marked "focus." At maximum "focus," the program would "think" rationally, formally, reasonably. As the dial was turned down and "focus" diminished, its "mind" would start to wander, and as you dialed even lower, this artificial mind would start to free-associate, eventually ignoring the user completely as it cruised off into the mental adventures we know as sleep.</p><p>While the program was a only a partial success, it laid the foundation for <em>The Tides of Mind</em>, a groundbreaking new exploration of the human psyche that shows us how the very purpose of the mind changes throughout the day. Indeed, as Gelernter explains, when we are at our most alert, when reasoning and creating new memories is our main mental business, the mind is a computer-like machine that keeps emotion on a short leash and attention on our surroundings. As we gradually tire, however, and descend the "mental spectrum," reasoning comes unglued. Memory ranges more freely, the mind wanders, and daydreams grow more insistent. Self-awareness fades, reflection blinks out, and at last we are completely immersed in our own minds.</p><p>With far-reaching implications, Gelernter&#x2019;s landmark "Spectrum of Consciousness" finally helps decode some of the most mysterious wonders of the human mind, such as the numinous light of early childhood, why dreams are so often predictive, and why sadism and masochism underpin some of our greatest artistic achievements. It&#x2019;s a theory that also challenges the very notion of the mind as a machine&#x2015;and not through empirical studies or "hard science" but by listening to our great poets and novelists, who have proven themselves as humanity's most trusted guides to the subjective mind and inner self.</p><p>In the great introspective tradition of Wilhelm Wundt and Ren� Descartes, David Gelernter promises to not only revolutionize our understanding of what it means to be human but also to help answer many of our most fundamental questions about the origins of creativity, thought, and consciousness.</p></p><p>David Gelernter is the author of eight books and a professor of computer science at Yale University.

Tomorrow&#39;s trains could travel through space at 23 times the speed of sound -- nearly 30 000 km/h (19 000 m.p.h.)! But did you know that train technology goes back 5 000 years? All aboard Ultimate Trains, which takes readers on a trip through the evolution of train technology, bringing to life the trains of yesterday, today and tomorrow. Five &#34;Build It Yourself&#34; experiments -- simple enough to create at home -- put train technology into action. Readers can learn how to build a steam engine from a soda pop can, test an electromagnetic track and go online to construct their own magnetic levitation train.</p><p>Peter McMahon is an online science journalist who has written for the Toronto Star, CTV and Science.ca. Peter also runs a consulting company that offers training and planning for children&#39;s science programming. He is the author of Ultimate Trains. Peter lives in Port Hope, Ontario.From the nostalgic sound of a locomotive chugging along to the whoosh of China&#x2019;s levitating maglev, it&#x2019;s hard not to be awed by trains. In simple, engaging text and illustrations, McMahon and Mora present a brief history of this mode of transportation. Integral to the book are five experiments children can create; four have detailed instructions; the fifth requires Internet access to complete. Each experiment ties in well with a particular type of train, features clear instructions, and offers safety precautions. The experiments could serve as the beginnings of science-fair projects for upper-elementary students. The book includes a glossary and an index. Though published in Canada, the only U.S.-centric slight is the lack of a mention of the Transcontinental Railroad. If this first book in the Machines of the Future series is an indication of quality, then it will be well received by both educators and children. Grades 4-7. --J. B. Petty</p><h2>Coltrane: The Story of a Sound</h2><p>A major work about the great saxophonist&#x2014;and about the state of jazz.<br>What was the essence of John Coltrane&#x2019;s achievement that makes him so prized forty years after his death? What was it about his improvising, his bands, his compositions, his place within his era of jazz that left so many musicians and listeners so powerfully drawn to him? What would a John Coltrane look like now&#x2014;or are we looking for the wrong signs?The acclaimed jazz writer Ben Ratliff addresses these questions in <i>Coltrane</i>. First Ratliff tells the story of Coltrane&#x2019;s development, from his first recordings as a no-name navy bandsman to his last recordings as a near-saint, paying special attention to the last ten years of his life, which contained a remarkable series of breakthroughs in a nearly religious search for deeper expression. <p></p>In the book&#x2019;s second half, Ratliff traces another history: that of Coltrane&#x2019;s influence and legacy. This story begins in the mid-&#x2019;50s and considers the reactions of musicians, critics, and others who paid attention, asking: Why does Coltrane signify so heavily in the basic identity of jazz?<p></p>Placing jazz among other art forms and American social history, and placing Coltrane not just among jazz musicians but among the greatest American artists, Ratliff tries to look for the sources of power in Coltrane&#x2019;s music&#x2014;not just in matters of technique, composition, and musical concepts, but in the deeper frequencies of Coltrane&#x2019;s sound.<p></p></p><p>Ben Ratliff has been a jazz critic at <i>The New York Times </i>since 1996. He lives in Manhattan with his wife and their two sons. His <i>New York Times Essential Library: Jazz </i>was published in 2002.Excerpt&nbsp;The common wisdom about the saxophonist John Coltrane is that he was the last major figure in the evolution of jazz, that the momentum of jazz stalled, and nearly stopped, after his death at age forty in 1967.<br>What was the essence of Coltrane&#x2019;s achievement that makes him so prized forty years after his death? Why have so many musicians and listeners been so powerfully drawn to him? What was it about his improvising, his bands, his compositions, his place within his era of jazz? What were the factors that helped Coltrane become who he was? And what would a John Coltrane look like now, or are we wrong to be looking for such a figure?<br>From the outside, one keeps wondering which musician will take the next decisively evolutionary step, as all those who seem to be candidates repeat themselves, become hermetic or obvious, fail to write compelling original material, sell out in some form, or begin to bore their audiences. And then one wonders whether evolutionary models should be applied to jazz at all. It seems to be the case that jazz loops around, retrenches, makes tiny adjustments that don&#x2019;t alter the basic language. The problem, though, is that Coltrane certainly made it seem as if jazz were evolving. He barreled ahead, and others followed. Some are still following.<br>His career, especially the last ten years of it, was so unreasonably exceptional that when he became seen as the representative jazz musician, the general comprehension of how and why jazz works became changed; it also became jagged and dangerous with half-truths. Every half-truth needs a full explanation.<br>This is not a book about Coltrane&#x2019;s life, but the story of his work. The first part tells the story of his music as it was made, from his first recordings as a no-name navy bandsman in 1946 until his death as a near-saint of jazz in 1967. The second part tells the story of his influence, starting in his lifetime and continuing until today. The reason that the two stories are separated&#x2014;even though one will cross over into the other&#x2019;s territory now and then&#x2014;is because the work and its reception have had distinct, different, and individually logical lives.<br>This is a book about jazz as sound. I mean &#x201c;sound&#x201d; as it has long functioned among jazz players, as a mystical term of art: as in, every musician finally needs a sound, a full and sensible embodiment of his artistic personality, such that it can be heard, at best, in a single note. Miles Davis&#x2019;s was fragile and pointed. Coleman Hawkins&#x2019;s was ripe and mellow and generous. John Coltrane&#x2019;s was large and dry, slightly undercooked, and urgent.<br>But I also mean sound as a balanced block of music emanating from a whole band. How important is this? With Coltrane, sound ruled over everything. It eventually superseded composition: his later records present one track after another of increasing similarity, in which the search for sound superseded solos and structure. His authoritative sound, especially as he could handle it in a ballad, was the reason older musicians respected him so&#x2014;his high-register sound, for example, in &#x201c;Say It Over and Over Again.&#x201d; But it was also the reason younger and less formally adept musicians were drawn to him, and why they could even find themselves a place on his bandstand.<br>Coltrane loved structure in music, and the science and theory of harmony; one of the ways he is remembered is as the champion student of jazz. But insofar as Coltrane&#x2019;s music has some extraordinary properties&#x2014;the power to make you change your consciousness a little bit&#x2014;we ought to widen the focus beyond the constructs of his music, his compositions, and his intellectual conceits. Eventually we can come around to the music&#x2019;s overall sound: first how it feels in the ear and later how it feels in the memory, as mass and as metaphor. Musical structure, for instance, can&#x2019;t contain morality. But sound, somehow, can. Coltrane&#x2019;s large, direct, vibratoless sound transmitted his basic desire: &#x201c;that I&#x2019;m supposed to grow to the best good that I can get to.&#x201d;<br>What Coltrane accomplished, and how he connected with audiences for jazz around the world, seems to elude any possible career plan, and is remarkably separate from what we have come to understand as European-based, Western-culture artistic consciousness. This book attempts to track the connections of his work&#x2014;how and why he proceeded from A to B to Z&#x2014;and then, later, to ask why Coltrane has weighed so heavily in the basic identity of jazz for the last half century.<br>Coltrane&#x2014;whose music is marked by remarkable technique, strength in all registers of the tenor and soprano saxophones, slightly sharp intonation, serene intensity, and a rapid, mobile exploration of chords, not just melody&#x2014;made jazz that was alternately seductive, mainstream, and antagonistic. Among his recordings were the high-speed harmonic �tude &#x201c;Giant Steps&#x201d; (1959); the exotic, ancient-sounding modal versions of &#x201c;My Favorite Things&#x201d; (1960) and &#x201c;Greensleeves&#x201d; (1961); the headlong, sometimes discordant, fifteen-minute blues in F, &#x201c;Chasin&#x2019; the Trane&#x201d; (1961); the devotional suite A Love Supreme (1964); the mournful ballads &#x201c;Soul Eyes&#x201d; (1962) and &#x201c;After the Rain&#x201d; (1963); and the whirligig free-jazz duet performance with drums alone, Interstellar Space (1967).<br>His work became unofficially annexed by the civil rights movement: its sound alone has become a metaphor for dignified perseverance. His art, nearly up to the end, was not insular, and kept signifying different things for different people of different cultures and races. His ugliest music (to a certain way of thinking) is widely suspected of possessing beauty beyond the listener&#x2019;s grasp, and the reverse goes for his prettiest music&#x2014;that it is more properly understood as an expression of grave seriousness. There is more poetry written about him, I would guess, than about any other jazz musician. And his religious quests through Christianity, Buddhism, Kabbalah, and Sufism are now embedded, ex post facto, in his music. In pluralistic America, it has become hard not to hear Coltrane&#x2019;s modal music&#x2014;in which an improviser, freed from chordal movement, becomes free to explore&#x2014;as a metaphor for a personal religious search.<br>Coltrane, particularly from 1961 to 1964, sounds like the thing we know as modern jazz, just the way that Stravinsky sounds like the thing we know as modern classical music. Young bandleaders, especially saxophonists, find him a safe place, the safe place. Some musicians may disagree on the basis of their own experiences&#x2014;jazz is hundreds of microclimates&#x2014;but here it is: the sound of so many jazz gigs I&#x2019;ve heard in the past fifteen years, as a jazz critic in New York, is usually the sound of albums like Coltrane&#x2019;s Sound or Coltrane Plays the Blues, the Coltrane quartet just before or in the first stages of a modal-jazz style, just tightening, still before A Love Supreme and that later music that is so personal that to borrow from it would be obvious. (Not that it isn&#x2019;t sometimes borrowed from, and not that such borrowing isn&#x2019;t usually obvious to the point of vulgarity.) He has been more widely imitated in jazz over the last fifty years than any other figure.<br>Some musicians have told me that after a period of immersion, they could not listen to him anymore. Listeners, too. I have played other kinds of music in bands, and studied with a jazz pianist, but I am a writer, not a jazz musician. When I first heard Coltrane&#x2019;s records as a teenager in the 1980s, the 1956 Prestige sessions with the Miles Davis Quintet&#x2014;&#x201c;Tune Up&#x201d; and &#x201c;If I Were a Bell&#x201d; especially&#x2014;he sounded to me like a great lake whose dimensions I knew I wanted to trace. Next was Giant Steps, with its brightness, concision, harmonic acuity, and strong original melodies. It did me no harm&#x2014;not until later, when I began to hear a rote mathematical stiffness in his playing that I reacted against. I wasn&#x2019;t alive in the early sixties, and perhaps for that reason The European Tour, a double-LP set of Coltrane&#x2019;s band recorded live in 1962 and 1963, first seemed to me the stylization of modal music, a soft, snake-charming lob toward the progressive, self-congratulating audiences accruing around Coltrane after his radio hit, &#x201c;My Favorite Things.&#x201d; I rejected it, pretty much.<br>But when I got to Live at the Village Vanguard, particularly the track &#x201c;Spiritual,&#x201d; I developed a block against it. This music was no half-stepping: deep and correct and serious, harder and more violently swinging and slightly ancient-sounding, the intimations of Coltrane&#x2019;s modal style before it hardened as a gesture. This band was the supreme consortium of live jazz, the one most related to jazz-as-it-is-currently-played. It seemed that you could go in there and not be able to find your way out.<br>I did have some sort of index for seriousness in jazz at that point. I was hearing a lot of music in New York that tried to be profound and occasionally was. The guitarist Sonny Sharrock and his loud band with two drummers made sense to me by its natural connections both to rock-and-roll and post-Coltrane free jazz - specifically to Pharoah Sanders&#x2019;s records of the late 1960s. The tenor saxophonist Charles Gayle and his trios played a kind of highly expressionistic collective improvisation, whose main factors were its manipulation of rhythmic chaos and the unpredictable charisma of Gayle himself. Another tenor player, David S. Ware, led a quartet which took the example of Coltrane in about 1965 to the next plane of loud-and-lugubrious; it was all density. On the other hand, David Murray&#x2019;s trio with Wilber Morris and Andrew Cyrille was more spindly and playful and pretty, with nice original lines, and a completely different story from Coltrane&#x2019;s. (Murray&#x2019;s allegiance was to melodic improvisation, the Sonny Rollins line of playing, as opposed to Coltrane&#x2019;s way of implying whole chords in his sweep.)<br>But those Coltrane records I shrank from faced up to the idea of density and noise without fetishizing it, and didn&#x2019;t stop there. Coltrane connected his own learned harmonic patterns with many outside approaches, picked up from other jazz musicians and various folk cultures&#x2014;a thoroughly willed, nearly maniacal method of inclusion. And he built a groove with his bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones that grew stronger, even as the rest of the music became heavy with super-extended soloing, the overload of individual will. The various sounds of Live at the Village Vanguard became some of jazz&#x2019;s most revisited majority languages, connecting schools of players who would otherwise have little to do with each other, formalists and non-formalists.<br>Anyway, two years went by before I tried listening seriously to Coltrane again. Now it was twenty-eight years after Live at the Village Vanguard was recorded, and the bohemian interior of the jazz audience in New York had become, as far as I could see, smaller and more self-conscious. Jazz&#x2019;s early-sixties identity as protest material for Americans who had a hard, bitter road out of the Great Society had since been celebrated, fetishized, and nostalgized; since the beginning of the 1980s, the music-as-music had been studied as an academic subject. Jazz, too, had crept into pop and hiphop. And a jazz-classicism movement, which exercised withering skepticism toward most of the loose-form and nonacoustic music that had happened in jazz after the mid-sixties, had gained fully funded legitimacy through house orchestras at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall and the Smithsonian.<br>The point I am making is that there were so many entryways to jazz by 1989 that I didn&#x2019;t necessarily want to deal with the most serious, uncomfortable, and perhaps necessary way in: immersion in John Coltrane&#x2019;s recordings. Part of that discomfort came from the fact that it had become totally unclear how to think of them. They form a path, but was it a path toward a new language or nonsense?<br>The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, as well as his brothers Branford (the saxophonist) and Delfeayo (the trombonist), and the critic Stanley Crouch&#x2014;who wrote a great deal of combative opinions associated with them&#x2014;had become extremely potent cultural commentators by that point. Wynton was in the business of selecting what was good and lasting across the entire history of jazz. Serving as faction boss, he talked persuasively about what had been watered down or lost in jazz: four-four swing, ballads, constructive competition, a sense of boundaries and exclusivity. He really loved to argue, and the gist of his arguments was always responsibility: whether you are doing good or harm to the music. (And not just to jazz, but, by extension, to American culture.) He talked about jazz as if it were a patient on a table. He prescribed the necessary measures musicians ought to be taking if they wanted jazz to survive at all.<br>Suddenly the life&#x2019;s work of Coltrane, and his gradual trajectory toward non-swing, non-ballads, non-competiveness, non-boundaried inclusion, could seem dangerous. But the fact remained that if you could stand to listen, really listen hard, to &#x201c;Spiritual,&#x201d; or the rest of Live at the Village Vanguard, both sides of the argument seemed shallow, and imposed from without by parties with an agenda. A record like that one indicated that the common-room of jazz was also, paradoxically, its darkest and most mysterious place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excerpted from Coltrane by Ben Ratliff.

Consequently, the color pink, which universally denotes awareness of the disease that kills more than 40,000 American women each year, appears on every page. The opening section of this welcoming and brimming volume features recipes and moving stories from women active in the movement. Eloise Caggiano, the program director for the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, for example, shares her family recipe for pot roast with gingersnap gravy and talks about how she was diagnosed with the disease at age 33. These early pages also present sobering information, such as the fact that 43 percent of breast-cancer patients skip treatments because they can&#x2019;t afford them. Good correctly notes that weight gain can increase breast-cancer risk, but that doesn&#x2019;t preclude put-on-the-pounds ingredients in some of the book&#x2019;s more than 700 easy slow-cooker recipes. Among the decadent but comforting dishes are seven-layer bars made with sweetened condensed milk. Of course, there are plenty of healthy recipes, from Chunky Vegetable Chili to Autumn Chicken and Veggies, Squash Casserole, and Wild Mushrooms Italian. A thoroughly useful, supportive, good-hearted cookbook. --Karen Springen</p><h2>Kiva Art of the Anasazi at Pottery Mound</h2><p>Illustrated with 109 figures in color.</p><p></p><h2>The Caves of Perigord</h2><p>A brilliant novel about the discovery of a fragment of a prehistoric cave painting that leads back to an episode of tragedy and heroism in WWII - and to the creation of the painting itself, 17,000 years ago. A piece of prehistoric stone art from the same period as the famous Lascaux cave paintings - 17,000 years ago - is brought to a London auction house by the son of a British hero of world War II, whose father left it to him. A storm of publicity ensues, which is only increased by the disappearance of the painting. Even the President of France becomes involved. As the story moves to France, both the tale of the stone&#39;s discovery, during the War, and its origins, millennia ago, are told in this wonderful novel which evokes both THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR and Ken Follett&#39;s THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH.</p><p>Martin Walker was the GUARDIAN&#39;s Washington bureau chief and assistant editor, and now works with the LOS ANGELES TIMES, NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST and other US publications. He has won many awards and now lives in Washington DC with his wife and two children.<p><b>Chapter 1: Time: The Present</b> </p><p> Every interesting woman has a private smile, and Lydia Dean was startled by a brief, tantalizing glimpse of her own. Its reflection suddenly flashed on the glass covering a poster as she entered her cramped attic office, then it faded. She might almost have imagined it, and certainly there was no cause to smile. Determined not to show how much the interview with Justin had upset her, she closed the door firmly behind her and contemplated the imminent ruin of her empire. Yet for the first time that day, and despite the faint dismay at the prospect of unemployment, she felt her spirits lifting. It was a wry mood, inspired mainly by her sense of the ridiculous. Lydia never ceased to be amazed at the odd way her mind worked, the portentous phrases that suddenly popped into her thoughts. Empire? Ruin of Empire? She was simply facing the loss of a job that she did not much enjoy, although it allowed her to combine a career in art with a decent income. </p><p> It was a kind of empire, she mused, as she gazed at the map of the ancient world that hung on her wall. Her territory stretched from ancient Greece back to the dawn of time, from the plains of India to the Pillars of Hercules. From Hittites to Hammurabi, she had traveled it and researched it, and could read some of its dead languages. As a student she had dug into its archaeological sites, extracted shards of pottery from harsh earth, and even sacrificed her toothbrush to scrub them clean. And now, despite her new skill at fending off passes from politically connected Ministers of Culture who could barely spell the word, she was trying, and probably failing, to make a living from it. </p><p> Why on earth had she been so self-indulgent, so intellectually lazy when she first came back to England to go to graduate school? She chided herself, an internal and critical dialogue she was conducting more and more frequently. Art history was not a <i>real</i> subject, not like law or computing, or even business. Perhaps she should have concentrated on archaeology, she thought, until disagreeable memories surfaced of muddy campsites, a sore back, and amorous fellow-diggers who smelled rank. Certainly she should never have given up the research at the institute into the medieval art she really loved. Money was not everything. But the mortgage had to be paid each month. And today it had been made subtly clear that the auction house was unlikely to keep on paying her handsome salary as long as the market in her field remained so dismally, so unprofitably flat. Preclassical art meant everything before the Greeks and Romans. From Ancient Egypt to Babylon, Persepolis to the Holy Land, Lydia's empire covered continents and millennia, and yet never managed to bring in the sales and commissions that even the most obscure Impressionist painter could command. </p><p> "You -- or rather your field -- hmmm -- not looking too promising, I'm afraid," the department head had mumbled over her modest list of proposals for the coming year. Like so many Englishmen, Justin spoke in irritating circumlocutions, as if grim news were best delivered impersonally. It wasn't just her field, she knew; her employers also blamed her. She had been hired not simply to trawl the market and scoop off the best for her auction house, but to find and charm the sellers with the best collections and to recruit rich customers. She understood, without any of her employers being crassly un-English enough to say so, that her youth and looks had secured her the job. But she was also expected to create the kind of buzz in her field that generated publicity and profits, and here she was failing miserably. She could offer only a few museum sales, which meant low prices, one private collection of Sumerian artifacts, and another of what could well have been looted from Scythian grave mounds, which would spell trouble. </p><p> "You are not living up to our hopes, Lydia," Justin had concluded, in that snooty way he had developed since she had declined his invitation to an intimate dinner. Justin, said the gossips in the ladies' room, was a predatory man. Lydia found him oily and distrusted his shirts, invariably blue checks or stripes, with white collars and cuffs. She was now careful to ask after the health of his wife and children. </p><p> It had been an unsettling meeting, leaving her with the distinct prospect of unemployment before the end of the year. Lydia walked across to her desk, and absentmindedly gave her usual pat to the head of the soapstone Egyptian cat that she had bought in Cairo, an evident but charming Fifth Dynasty fake, and told herself she had a right to feel miserable. Her career had stalled. Her window was speckled with a London drizzle and the mean, gray light belied the first hesitant buds of the daffodils she had seen in the park that morning. So, gloomily leafing through sale catalogs and trying not to recall that her thirtieth birthday was only months away, Lydia thought about changing her career. Evening classes, perhaps another degree through the Open University; she might consider economics or law. She couldn't afford to go back to law school in the States, even if she had wanted to. She wasn't ready to go home, nor back to mother, who was embarrassingly short of money since Lydia's father had died. And America had too many lawyers, anyway. The law here was different. Lawyers made money, and seemed always to be in demand. And David had been neither bored nor boring, and could even be quite amusing about his work as a patent lawyer. Firmly, she steered her mind away from that topic. Their relationship had been pleasant, but ultimately insufficient. </p><p> David was history. But then her career was facing a similar fate. So when reception rang to say they had a walk-in, she felt just the slightest flutter of hope. For her colleagues in paintings and furniture and jewelry, walk-ins were almost drudgery, constant interruptions to look at some battered family heirloom proffered by someone with a glint of avarice in the eye. Lydia hardly ever had walk-ins, and the handful she had seen were obvious fakes, offloaded on some gullible British soldier or sailor on leave in Cairo or Baghdad. The staff on the reception desk could usually tell at a glance but preferred to leave the official verdict to the experts like Lydia. </p><p> She walked down the stairs to the front hall -- a tall, fit-looking man in a tweedy country suit and heavy brogues was being shown into the waiting room. His age seemed to be somewhat less than forty, but he dressed as if he were closer to sixty. The parcel he carried, carefully wrapped in brown paper and string, was obviously heavy but did not affect what Lydia suspected was a military stride. The tie was an anonymous heavy silk. His hair was short, his manner affable but brisk, and he smelled faintly of carbolic soap, a distinct improvement on Justin's musky cologne. He put the parcel on the table, gave her a smile with an amused twinkle in the eyes, held out his hand, and said, "How do you do? My name is Manners. I have just inherited this from my father and want to know if it's worth selling." </p><p> Lydia knew the country well enough to recognize from his speech and his dress a member of England's comfortable classes, old money and older schools. She shook his hand, introduced herself, and opened a drawer in the table to offer him a knife or a pair of scissors, but he was carefully unknotting the string. "I think it was an heirloom from the war," he said. "India, the Middle East, that sort of place. That's where my father served, mainly. He was a regular soldier, and retired to live quietly in Wiltshire for the past thirty years. This rock has been at home for as long as I can remember." </p><p> Lydia felt her face muscles tighten as the brown paper was unwrapped and the wooden case emerged, three or four times thicker than the usual picture frame to display something that shocked her. It was beautiful. There was no other word for it. Whenever and wherever this had been done, last week in some forger's garret or millennia ago, this assemblage of shape and color and texture punched her with a palpable force. Deliberately clamping down on the rush of wonder, she closed her eyes, freezing her excitement with a cold sense of professional duty. She must not jump to conclusions, but the usual checklist of culture, period, location, and style would not help her much here. One likely candidate leaped to mind, and she firmly repressed the thought. Remember the rules, Lydia; this had to be a logical process. The Hagar mountains of the Sahara might be a possibility, she was thinking, or part of a frieze from one of the rock churches of Cappadocia. She was trying to remember what little she knew of the rock art of Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, but Africa felt wrong. And it was certainly not from Australia. Possibly it was Yemeni, or perhaps India from the Deccan caves. But this beast was too fierce for any Hindu culture. The jaw was far too powerful, and the horns were curved like offensive, not defensive weapons. It was not just a kind of bull, she told herself as she opened her eyes again and focused on the power of that massive neck, the lethal swoop of horn. It was the essence of the beast. Fleetingly, an image surfaced from a holiday in Spain, the <i>corrida</i> of the feast of San Isidro in Madrid, prancing horses and a bull such as this, and blood in the ring. </p><p> But even as she tried to organize her thoughts, she felt a kind of outrage. It was a desecration of what had been a much larger painting, a chunk of rock just over a foot square and of uneven thickness, which had clearly been chiseled or levered with a crowbar from a rock face. Something marvelous had been defaced. This was the worst kind of loot, wrenched greedily from its setting, as if the looter had destroyed an ancient church to steal a single fresco. She looked up coldly at her customer. But Manners was oblivious to her reaction. He proudly displayed his heirloom, mounted on a dark velvet backcloth inside its thick wooden frame, and stood back, gazing hopefully at her as if expecting approval. </p><p> Lydia took a deep breath, wondering how to begin this conversation. She looked down again at the crude but somehow noble outline of an elongated horned animal in faded red and black, with some other scrawls on the edge of the rock, where the rest of the painting had been broken off and ruined when this slab of rock was wrenched free. She had to touch it, sure that some kind of illuminating force would flow from the rock into her fingers, explaining its origins and its power. Unsure of what it was or whence it came, all her instincts told her that this was the real thing. How could she ever have thought about changing her career? No lawyer ever felt like this. Perhaps doctors felt this sense of exultation when they saved a life, or perhaps teachers when a pupil suddenly surged into a new state of knowledge. She had not felt like this for a very long time. </p><p> "Do you have any more of this at home, or is this the only piece?" she asked. </p><p> "The only one," he replied. "My father had it in his study, standing on a bookcase. He never mentioned it, except to say it was a souvenir of the war -- of the most dangerous part of his war. And that he had made the case himself. The only other thing he ever said was to my mother, and he told her that he knew it was at least seventeen thousand years old." </p><p> "Hardly," said Lydia politely. Her voice sounded almost normal, as her brain began to work again in its accustomed grooves. "If it is from North Africa, the Hagar paintings were still being done just a few hundred years ago. Cappadocian work might be seventeen hundred years old, but seventeen thousand years would predate whatever we now think of as the kind of civilization that could produce this kind of work. If it is genuine." </p><p> There were swiveling brass arms on the rear of the case. She pushed them sideways to remove the glass and with a brisk "Allow me," her visitor lifted the large and not quite flat chunk of stone free from the velvet. She took a magnifying glass from the drawer, and turned a spotlight onto the edge of the rock, studying what seemed to be a long scorch mark along the side of the rock. Perhaps the burning from some sort of thermal lance that had cut it free? Seventeen thousand years, she was thinking. There was one obvious candidate, too obvious to be possible. </p><p> "Did your father serve in France or Spain at all?" she asked quietly, her brain quickening but her stomach lurching at the thought of Lascaux or Altamira. Nobody could ever have done this to Lascaux. The French would bring back the guillotine for anyone who tried. So they should. She would even volunteer to sharpen the blade. </p><p> "Yes. As a matter of fact he was in France. Not for long. But in 1944, around the time of the invasion." She was suddenly aware of a sharper note in his voice, and a concentration as he looked at her. </p><p> "The P�rigord, perhaps? The Dordogne region?" Through the magnifying glass, the lines of the bull looked coarse as well as decisive. Clay, she thought. Not finger-daubed, but a shaped point of tinted clay used as a kind of pencil. The muscles of the neck had been given force by a thinner layer of dappled color. How could that have been done? She curled her hand into a loose fist and put it to her mouth, remembering some long-ago lecture. Yes, this must be an example of the blowing technique. A wash of color in the artist's mouth, half-spat and half-sprayed through a half-closed fist would produce that effect. The rock had to be limestone. She was no expert on the oldest cave paintings of prehistoric man, but she knew that the bulls at Lascaux were ten, even twenty times larger than this. And she was certain that a painting such as this was never found outside its cave, and there was nothing of such size in any museum she knew. But if the rock were from the Lascaux culture, it would be priceless, and even historic. Unbidden, the thought came that this could be the very item to save her career. Properly handled, she told herself. It could also unleash the kind of scandal that could ruin her. </p><p> "Yes, I think he was in the Dordogne area," said Manners. "He was attached to Special Operations, with the French Resistance and all that. The summer of 1944, around the time of the D-Day invasion, I know he was in P�rigord. He got a French decoration, the <i>L�gion d'Honneur.</i> But this isn't French, is it?" </p><p> "I don't know," she said automatically, playing for time as the excitement surged through her again. "I'll have to check. If it comes from one of the French caves, then it could be seventeen thousand years old, or even older. But it would be about as illegal as any artifact could possibly be. We couldn't possibly sell it," she said, straightening to look gravely at the man. There was no twinkle in his eye now, indeed, no expression at all, which irritated her. "This is not portable art, in any event. It has been cut from the living rock, from a rather larger painting. In artistic terms, and probably legally, this is a crime." </p><p> He looked at her silently, his head cocked slightly to one side as if he were about to speak. His self-confidence made him quite an attractive man, she thought. She felt herself blushing, and he carefully took ...</p></p><h2>The Note: A Story of Second Chances</h2><p>Assigned to cover the tragedy when PanWorld flight 848 crashes into Tampa Bay, killing all 261 people on board, journalist Peyton MacGruder learns of a father&#39;s dying attempt to convey forgiveness upon his son and finds her own life changed.

At New York's bustling LaGuardia Airport, thousands of passengers clutched belongings, flashed driver's licenses, and gripped boarding passes before departing for far-flung destinations across the globe.</p> <p>Every one of them had made plans for the evening. </p> <p>At gate B-13, 237 passengers waited for a jet that would carry them to Tampa International Airport. Their reasons for traveling were as varied as their faces: some hoped for a few days of fun, others looked forward to work, others yearned to see family. A pleasant mood reigned in the lounge area despite the jet's late arrival. Chuck O'Neil, one of the PanWorld gate attendants, told jokes to pass the time. Four standby passengers smiled in relief when they were told seats were available. </p> <p>PanWorld Flight 848, which had originated at TIA, touched down at LaGuardia at 2:38 p.m., almost an hour late. Two hundred fifty passengers and crew disembarked from the Boeing 767, which had developed problems with a pressure switch in the No. 1 engine. The trouble was nothing unusual, considering the age of the twenty-two-year-old plane, and Tampa mechanics had corrected the problem while others performed routine maintenance.</p> <p>In the gate area, families kissed their loved ones good-bye while other travelers placed last-minute calls on their cell phones. Five passengers were PanWorld employees utilizing one of their employment perks: free travel on any flight with available seating. Debbie Walsh, a ticket agent with PanWorld, was taking her nine-year-old son to visit his father in Florida. </p> <p>Forty-nine-year-old Captain Joey Sergeant of Tampa stepped out for a cup of fresh coffee before returning to the cockpit. With him were flight engineer Ira Nipps, sixty-two, of Bradenton, Florida, and first officer Roy Murphy of Clearwater. Together the three men had logged more than forty-six thousand hours of flight experience. </p> <p>On the tarmac, PanWorld employees loaded the belly of the plane with golf bags, suitcases, backpacks, and two kennels-one occupied by a basset hound belonging to the Cotter family from Brooklyn, another by a ten-week-old Siberian Husky, a present for passenger Noland Thompson's grandchildren in Clearwater. While baggage handlers sweated in the afternoon sun, mechanics poured twenty-four thousand gallons of fuel into the jet. </p> <p>The flight attendants boarded the waiting travelers with little fuss. Among the 237 passengers were Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Wilt, who planned to cruise the Caribbean from the port of Tampa; Dr. and Mrs. Merrill Storey, who hoped to buy a condo in St. Petersburg; and the Darrell Nance family-two parents and four children, all bound for Disney World after a day at Busch Gardens. First-class passenger Tom Harold, defensive coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, boarded with his wife, Adrienne. To celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary, the couple had taken a quick trip to New York to catch her favorite play, Les Mis�rables, on Broadway. </p> <p>Forty-eight of the PanWorld passengers were students from Largo Christian School-recent graduates whose senior class trip had been postponed until mid-June to avoid conflicting with final exams. The students and their nine chaperones had missed an earlier flight, and many were openly thanking God that the airline could accommodate the entire group on Flight 848.</p> <p>Shortly before 4:00 p.m., flight attendants sealed the doors, then airline workers pushed the 767 back from the gate. On the flight deck, Captain Sergeant started the four Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. After checking with air traffic controllers in the tower, the plane taxied to its assigned runway. </p> <p>At 4:05, controllers cleared the jet for takeoff. By 4:15, Flight 848 was airborne, her wheels tucked back into the well, her nose lifted toward the stratosphere. After a short circling climb over New York Harbor, Captain Sergeant began a graceful turn to the south, toward Florida and sunny skies. </p> <p>The pilots couldn't have asked for better weather. Temperatures in Tampa were in the high eighties, the humidity a sultry 70 percent. No clouds marred the horizon for as far as the pilots could see. The captain took the jet to 35,000 feet, typical cruising altitude for the 767, and held it at 530 miles per hour. Once the plane was safely settled into her flight path, he checked the passenger list and noticed that he flew with two empty seats. Florida flights often sold out at this time of year. </p> <p>The passengers set about the business of making time pass as quickly as possible. They closed their eyes to nap, clamped on headphones, browsed through magazines, or peered at dusty paperbacks they'd picked up from the airport bookstore. The high school graduates in the back of the plane laughed and shouted across the aisles as they shared stories of their Manhattan adventure.</p> <p>The flight attendants unfastened their seat belts and whisked out the drink carts, murmuring "Watch your elbows" with every step they took down the aisle. </p> <p>One of those flight attendants was Natalie Moore. She had joined the flight in New York at the last moment, filling in for a steward who had taken ill. Before leaving New York she told a roommate she was looking forward to her first visit to Tampa. A rookie with the airline, she had graduated from flight school in Atlanta and moved into Kew Gardens, a New York neighborhood primarily populated by young flight attendants who worked out of LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports. </p> <p>As the hands of her watch moved toward five o'clock, Natalie and her coworkers began to serve dinner. Passengers had a choice of entr�es: baked chicken breast or sirloin steak, both accompanied by green beans and salad. As soon as the flight attendants served the last of the dinner trays, they cleared their cart and pushed it aft to begin cleanup. The flight from New York to Tampa did not allow much time for lingering over dinner, and only because Flight 848 flew during the dinner hour was a meal offered at all. </p> <p>At 6:06, after nearly two hours of uneventful flight, Captain Sergeant began his descent. At 6:18, air traffic controllers at Tampa International cleared the incoming flight to drop from 15,000 to 13,000 feet. As usual, the pilot responded by repeating his instructions: "PW 848, out of one-five for one-three." </p> <p>On board, passengers on the right side of the plane caught a dazzling view of Florida's Sun Coast-white beaches, pool-studded backyards, and green treetops, all bordered by the wide, blue expanse of the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>In the galleys, flight attendants locked the drink carts into their stowed positions, getting ready to make a final pass down the aisle. Natalie Moore moved through the cabin reminding passengers to be sure their seatbacks and tray tables were in their upright and locked positions. As she waited for a rambunctious teenager to comply, she bent to glance at the horizon. The sun, slipping toward the ocean, had painted the sky in a riot of pinks and yellows. </p> <p>At 13,389 feet, while Natalie and the other crew members went about their work, the torrent of air rushing past a loose screw on the fuselage outside the fuel tank created a spark. The electrical fuses tripped, and at 6:29 the plane's radio and transponders fell silent. Captain Sergeant sent a distress call, but no one heard it. </p> <p>The loose screw continued to spark. </p> <p>A few moments later, a man sitting in row 24, seat C, noticed three of the attendants huddled in the galley, their arms around each other. One wiped away a tear, while another bowed her head as if to pray. </p> <p>"Isn't that nice." He nudged the woman sitting next to him. "Look-they've had a tiff, and now they're making up." </p> <p>Their disagreement must not have been serious, for the flight attendants immediately separated. "Ladies and gentlemen," a male voice called over the intercom, "this is the captain. Please give attention to the flight attendant in your section of the plane. We have experienced a loss of power due to an electrical disruption, but we can still land safely. In order to prepare for this event, however, we ask that you remove all eyeglasses, then give your attention to the flight attendants as they demonstrate the crash position." </p> <p>Leaning forward, the man in 24-C looked out the window and saw that they were descending in a curving path, moving over water toward land. Though the atmosphere in the cabin hummed with tension, he remained hopeful. The jet was coming down in a relatively smooth spiral above the choppy waters between the Howard Frankland and Causeway Campbell Bridges. The airport lay just beyond. </p> <p>As the people around him fumbled to obey the flight attendants, he pulled a sheet of paper from his coat pocket and scribbled a message. Glancing out the window again, he saw the blue of the water and felt a flash of inspiration. Digging in another pocket, he produced a plastic bag, then tucked the note inside and secured the seal. </p> <p>Smiling, he looked up at the pale stewardess standing in the aisle, her mouth a small, tight hyphen. "Sorry," he said, noticing that everyone around him had already bent forward to prepare for an emergency landing. "I wanted to take care of something. I'm sure we'll be all right, so tonight I'll laugh and give this to my-"</p> <p>He never finished his sentence. A spark from the fuselage ignited the fuel vapors, and Flight 848 exploded. At 6:33 p.m., pieces of the plane began to rain down into the waters of Tampa Bay. </p> <p>Among the shards and debris was a note.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Bios</h2><p>Zoe Fisher has been genetically engineered to explore the planet Isis, which contains a wealth of information about alien life; but Zoe&#39;s mission may be endangered by the secrets of her own past. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>In the 22nd century, humanity discovers life on an extrasolar planet, Isis: life that is lush, beautiful--and deadly.

With partner Joe Simon, Kirby first made his mark in comics in the 1940s by drawing and/or creating numerous features for DC Comics including Sandman, the Newsboy Legion and Manhunter and Marvel including Captain America, the Young Allies, and the Kid Commandos. As the most valued team in comics, Simon and Kirby went on to create titles and concepts including Fighting American, Boys' Ranch and the creation of the romance comics genre. &nbsp;In 1961, the first issue of Marvel's&nbsp;<i>Fantastic Four</i>&nbsp;cemented Kirby's reputation as comics' preeminent creator, and a slew of famous titles followed that elevated him to legendary status, including<i>&nbsp;Incredible Hulk, Avengers&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;X-Men</i>. &nbsp;Kirby returned to DC in 1971 with his classic FOURTH WORLD TRILOGY, which was followed by THE DEOMON and KAMANDI. &nbsp;Kirby continued working and innovating in comics until his death in 1994.After DC pulled the plug on Kirby&#x2019;s ambitious New Gods (see Jack Kirby&#x2019;s Fourth World Omnibus, v.1, 2007; v.2, 2007; v.3, 2007; v.4, 2008) in 1972, the artist was still under contract, and Kirby, who generated ideas like normal people produce dandruff, came up with more series concepts, including this one set in &#x201c;the world that&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; in which corporate drone Buddy Blank is transformed by the AI-enabled satellite Brother Eye into a superpowered &#x201c;One Man Army Corps&#x201d; to police the world for the faceless Global Peace Agency. Oddball even by the eccentric standards of Kirby&#x2019;s later work, O.M.A.C. opens with the image of a disassembled female &#x201c;Build-a-Friend&#x201d; robot-in-a-box that ranks among the more disquieting visions in mainstream comics. Lacking the loopy humor that typically leavened Kirby&#x2019;s stories of the time only heightened O.M.A.C.&#x2019;s grim intensity, and his characteristically bold, kinetic artwork ratcheted up over-the-top fervency even further. The comic ended after only eight issues, when Kirby returned to Marvel. Although O.M.A.C. was revived and reinvented by others, Kirby&#x2019;s original stories are unparalleled. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Born Brothers</h2><p>Focuses on the seemingly idyllic relationship between two brothers, Jerome and Charles, that, over a period of more than twenty years, takes on growing overtones of competitiveness, buried sexuality, and self-destruction</p><p>Larry Woiwode is a novelist and the poet laureate of North Dakota, where he resides.First met in Beyond the Bedroom Wall, Jerome and Charles Neumiller are the focus of this monumental novel that conveys the brothers' symbiotic bond and the mixture of love, resentment, competitiveness and protectiveness that distinguishes their relationship. Charles narrates the interlocking segments, moving back and forth in setting, between North Dakota, Illinois amd New York, and in time, from childhood to adult years. Often elliptical and oblique, and initially somewhat confusing, the vignettes gain strength and resonance as they cumulatively depict the events of the brothers' lives. Woiwode is adept at evoking the early impressions, misapprehensions and fears of childhood, as well as its tender or exciting moments; the sexual stirrings, small triumphs and humiliations of adolescence; the subtle undercurrents of family life. His language pulses with energy and stinging images. Some long scenes could stand on their own: a fire that threatens to engulf a small town; stunned relatives coming together in grief when the boys' mother dies; a car accident that unrolls in agonizing slow motion. The narrative coalesces into a composite, many-dimensioned portrait that chronicles other milestones in the Neumillers' lives. While Jerome achieves a stable marriage and professional success as a physician, for Charles, after early promise as a radio personality, there is a downward spiral of drugs and alcohol, marital breakup, a suicide attempt. The story is permeated with references to the family's Catholic faith, once a source of strength to Charles, but increasingly of elusive comfort as a disappointment and despair threaten to overwhelm him. Although the accretion of its many scenes add to the power of this novel, there are times when Woiwode seems self-indulgent in his inclusion of material. Despite the occasional slackening of dramatic momentum, however, most readers will be willingly drawn into the narrative as Woiwode explores the mysterious patterns of human existence. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Perpetual Almanack of Folklore</h2><p>This almanack provides an entry for each day of the year, featuring farming and gardening tips, recipes, herbal remedies, church festivals and saints&#39; days.</p><p></p><h2>The Longest Way Home</h2><p>Caught in the midst of a rebellion while visiting a friend thousands of miles from home, Joseph, the young heir to the great House Keilloran, finds himself fighting for survival in enemy territory, through which he must travel while facing terrible dangers. By the author of The King of Dreams.</p><p>Robert Silverberg has won five Nebula Awards, four Hugo Awards, and the prestigious <i>Prix Apollo.</i> He is the author of more than one hundred science fiction and fantasy novels -- including the best-selling Lord Valentine trilogy and the classics <i>Dying Inside</i> and <i>A Time of Changes</i> -- and more than sixty nonfiction works. Among the sixty-plus anthologies he has edited are <i>Legends</i> and <i>Far Horizons,</i> which contain original short stories set in the most popular universe of Robert Jordan, Stephen King, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card, and virtually every other bestselling fantasy and SF writer today. Mr. Silverberg's Majipoor Cycle, set on perhaps the grandest and greatest world ever imagined, is considered one of the jewels in the crown of speculative fiction.<p></p>A 15-year-old boy named Joseph finds himself far away from home during an uprising on a distant planet. The planet's culture is fully realized through observations Joseph makes during his travels. There's not much dialogue here, and not much action either. Robert Silverberg paints a vivid and detailed picture of this foreign world and its inhabitants, but the story is slow and at times tedious. Stefan Rudnicki does a fine job with the narration, which is in one voice throughout. Where the story allows, he adds interesting character.

Featured in sixty alternative weeklies and college newspapers, representing a combined readership of more than six million, <i>Red Meat</i> has a fervent and loyal fan base. <br> <br>Max Cannon also has an official <i>Red Meat</i> web site, which averages 30,000 page views per week. It was honored with a Cyber Star award from <i>Virtual City</i> magazine.<br></p><p>What's funnier, a dead monkey or a dead clown? How many corpses do you have to tie together to make a raft? Are pigeons recyclable? These, and many other questions we're too afraid to include here, are answered in the latest installment from cult cartoonist Max Cannon, <i>More Red Meat</i>. Cannon's oeuvre can be found in countless weekly papers, on Web sites, and on the sides of buildings; it has infiltrated like a particularly unpleasant strain of the Ebola virus. Plumbing the depths of ickiness--and finding it funny--Cannon has gained a fanatical following for his rubber-coated look at suburban life. This latest collection includes Cannon's classic characters like the sadistic Milkman Dan, the mentally unstable Earl, and perverted, often-naked middle-class dad Ted Johnson, as well as introducing new characters such as the sadistic marine biologist Jacques Oiseux, the mentally unstable barber Walker, and deformed, middle-class outcast Johnny Lemonhead.

Raised in Savannah, Mercer brought a quintessentially southern style to both his life in New York and to his lyrics, which often evoked the landscapes and mood of his youth ("Moon River", "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening"). Mercer also absorbed the music of southern blacks--the lullabies his nurse sang to him as a baby and the spirituals that poured out of Savannah's churches-and that cool smooth lyrical style informed some of his greatest songs, such as "That Old Black Magic".<br><br>Part of a golden guild whose members included Cole Porter and Irving Berlin, Mercer took Hollywood by storm in the midst of the Great Depression. Putting words to some of the most famous tunes of the time, he wrote one hit after another, from "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby" to "Jeepers Creepers" and "Hooray for Hollywood." But it was also in Hollywood that Mercer's dark underside emerged. Sober, he was a kind, generous and at times even noble southern gentleman; when he drank, Mercer tore into friends and strangers alike with vicious abuse. Mercer's wife Ginger, whom he'd bested Bing Crosby to win, suffered the cruelest attacks; Mercer would even improvise cutting lyrics about her at parties.<br><br>During World War II, Mercer served as Americas's troubadour, turning out such uplifting songs as "My Shining Hour" and "Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive." He also helped create Capitol Records, the first major West Coast recording company, where he discovered many talented singers, including Peggy Lee and Nat King Cole. During this period, he also began an intense affair with Judy Garland, which rekindled time and again for the rest of their lives. Although they never found happiness together, Garland became Mercer's muse and inspired some of his most sensuous and heartbreaking lyrics: "Blues in the Night," "One for My Baby," and "Come Rain or Come Shine."<br><br>Mercer amassed a catalog of over a thousand songs and during some years had a song in the Top Ten every week of the year--the songwriting equivalent of Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak--but was plagued by a sense of failure and bitterness over the big Broadway hit that seemed forever out of reach.<br><br>Based on scores of interviews with friends, family and colleagues, and drawing extensively on Johnny Mercer's letters, papers and his unpublished autobiography, <i>Skylark</i> is an important book about one of the great and dramatic characters in 20th century popular music.<br></p><p>Philip Furia is the author of <i>Irving Berlin: A Life in Song</i> and <i>Ira Gershwin: The Art of the Lyricist</i>. He lives in Wilmington North Carolina.<br>In this sensitive and wonderfully in-depth work on the lyricist of classics like "One for the Road" and "Moon River," Furia (Ira Gershwin: The Art of the Lyricist) displays his talent for writing about the giants in American popular song. Georgia-born Mercer (1909-1976) spent most of his life among New York songwriters such as Irving Berlin and Cole Porter as well as such Hollywood stars as Bing Crosby and Judy Garland, but Furia expertly details how "his genteel southern background would always set him apart" in his lyrics ("Mercer, alone among the great songwriters of his generation, was, from the day he was born, influenced by the music of blacks") as well as his personal life, including his alcoholism. Furia also captures all of the successes and failures in Mercer's long career: his many Academy Award wins; his creation of Capitol Records; his collaboration with composer Harold Arlen, which helped both of them create songs and lyrics "that endure as timeless standards"; and his never having a true hit Broadway play because his "concentration on the emotional mood of a melody limited him" after the American musical's post-Oklahoma! emphasis on character and theatricality. Furia also details the influence of Mercer's love affair with Judy Garland on "the new depth of sorrow" that suddenly appears in Mercer's work with Arlen. Apart from including a few out-of-tune facts about Garland's sexual habits not related to Mercer, Furia makes it clear that Garland had become Mercer's "muse." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Backpack Books: 1001 Facts About Dinosaurs (Backpack Books)</h2><p>Photographs and text provide detailed information about dinosaurs and the Earth at the time of their reign.</p><p></p><h2>The Seven Secrets of Somewhere Lake (Living Forest Series, Volume 7)</h2><p>Animal ways that inspire and amaze!

The prayers express the ecstatic distress of the heart, convinced of its sinful and creaturely unworthiness, overwhelmed by God&#x2019;s loving condescension. As a doctor or teacher of the Universal Church, his work, with its specifically eastern cultural and theological ethos, is now recognised as inspiration for all. On April 12, 2015 Pope Francis officially declared St Gregory of Narek a Doctor of the Universal Church, following a pronouncement of his intentions on February 21st. The recognition coincided with the marking of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.</p><p>The Reverend Dr. Vrej Nerses Nersessian was born in Tehran and graduated from King&#x2019;s College London (BD 1972) and received his PhD (1975) from the Department of Greek and Byzantine Studies. He was ordained priest of the Armenian Apostolic Church in 1983. From 1975 to his retirement in 2012 he was the Curator of the Christian Middle East Section in the British Library. His last publication for the British Library was a Catalogue of the Armenian Manuscripts in the British Library acquired since the year 1913 and of collection in other libraries in the United Kingdom, London, 2012. In 2005 he was awarded Honorary Doctorate by the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia for his services to Armenian Studies and Art History.

By the time the last diary shuts, there have been great changes in the Mortmain household, not the least of which is that Cassandra is deeply, hopelessly, in love. Illustrations .</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain wants to become a writer. Trouble is, she's the daughter of a once-famous author with a severe case of writer's block. Her family--beautiful sister Rose, brooding father James, ethereal stepmother Topaz--is barely scraping by in a crumbling English castle they leased when times were good. Now there's very little furniture, hardly any food, and just a few pages of notebook paper left to write on. Bravely making the best of things, Cassandra gets hold of a journal and begins her literary apprenticeship by refusing to face the facts. She writes, "I have just remarked to Rose that our situation is really rather romantic, two girls in this strange and lonely house. She replied that she saw nothing romantic about being shut up in a crumbling ruin surrounded by a sea of mud."<p> Rose longs for suitors and new tea dresses while Cassandra scorns romance: "I know all about the facts of life. And I don't think much of them." But romantic isolation comes to an end both for the family and for Cassandra's heart when the wealthy, adventurous Cotton family takes over the nearby estate. Cassandra is a witty, pensive, observant heroine, just the right voice for chronicling the perilous cusp of adulthood. Some people have compared <i>I Capture the Castle</i> to the novels of Jane Austen, and it's just as well-plotted and witty. But the Mortmains are more bohemian--as much like the Addams Family as like any of Austen's characters. Dodie Smith, author of <i>101 Dalmations</i>, wrote this novel in 1948. And though the story is set in the 1930s, it still feels fresh, and well deserves its reputation as a modern classic. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>"<i>I Capture the Castle</i> is finally back in print. It should be welcomed with a bouquet of roses and a brass band. Ever since I was handed a tattered copy years ago with the recommendation 'You'll love it,' it has been one of my favorite novels. Cassandra Mortmain is one hell of a narrator, offering sharp wit, piercing insight and touching lyricism. She is a heroine we readers wish we could be, a young woman it is impossible not to adore." --Susan Isaacs<p> "Dreamy and funny...an odd, shimmering timelessness clings to its pages. A thousand and one cheers for its reissue. A+" --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p> "It is an occasion worth celebrating when a sparkling novel, a work of wit, irony and feeling is brought back into print after an absence of many years. So uncork the champagne for <i>I Capture the Castle</i>." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p> "It's as fresh as if it were written this morning and as classic as Jane Austen. I'm very happy to have met it." --Donald Westlake</p><p> "A delicious, compulsively readable novel about young love and its vicissitudes. What fun!" --Erica Jong</p><p> "Much more fun than the reader has any right to expect." --<i>The Weekly Standard</i></p></p><h2>Do I Come Here Often</h2><p>In Do I Come Here Often?

Brinkley</h2><p>Tells the story of the infamous "Goat Gland Doctor"&#x2015;controversial medical charlatan, groundbreaking radio impresario, and prescient political campaigner&#x2015;and recounts his amazing rags to riches to rags career. A popular joke of the 1920s posed the question, "What's the fastest thing on four legs?" The punch line? "A goat passing Dr. Brinkley's hospital!"<br><br>It seems that John R. Brinkley's virility rejuvenation cure&#x2015;transplanting goat gonads into aging men&#x2015;had taken the nation by storm. Never mind that "Doc" Brinkley's medical credentials were shaky at best and that he prescribed medication over the airwaves via his high-power radio stations. The man built an empire. The Kansas Medical Board combined with the Federal Radio Commission to revoke Brinkley's medical and radio licenses, which various courts upheld. Not to be stopped, Brinkley started a write-in campaign for Governor. He received more votes than any other candidate but lost due to invalidated and "misplaced" ballots.<br><br>Brinkley's tactics, particularly the use of his radio station and personal airplane, changed political campaigning forever. Brinkley then moved his radio medical practice to Del Rio, Texas, and began operating a "border blaster" on the Mexico side of the Rio Grande. His rogue stations, XER and its successor XERA, eventually broadcast at an antenna-shattering 1,000,000 watts and were not only a haven for Brinkley's lucrative quackery, but also hosted an unprecedented number of then-unknown country musicians and other guests.</p><p><b>R.

In lyric poems by turns droll and desolate, Hopler documents the struggle to live in the face of great loss, a task that sends him ranging through Florida's torrid subtropics, the mountains of the American West, the streets of Rome, and the Umbrian countryside. Vivid, dynamic, unrestrained: <i>The Abridged History of Rainfall</i> is a festival of glowing saints and fighting cocks, of firebombs and birdsong.</p><p><b>Jay Hopler</b> is the author of <i>Green Squall</i> and the editor (with Kimberly Johnson) of <i>Before the Door of God: An Anthology of Devotional Poetry.</i> The recipient of, among other awards and prizes, the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award, the Great Lakes Colleges Association New Writers Award, a fellowship from the Lannan Foundation, the Whiting Writers&#x2019; Award, and the Rome Prize in Literature, he teaches in the writing program at the University of South Florida.<b>A National Book Award Finalist</b><br><br>"Hopler&#x2019;s music depicts a human being at its most hesitant. It hymns that moment when the spirit isn&#x2019;t quite certain whether to laugh or cry, when the spirit grieves smiling. What strange music lives on these pages! The kind that would make Wallace Stevens proud. Repeat this with me: Hopler&#x2019;s music would make Wallace Stevens proud. That&#x2019;s a fact. No other way to say this: Jay Hopler is a majestic poet. A true artist. His is the art that lets us laugh and be sad in the same stanza often in the same word." Ilya Kaminsky, author of <i>Dancing in Odessa</i><br><br>"'I couldn't make myself believe,' writes Hopler in what may be the dark thesis of this dark book. And yet, what stunning evening light he shows us. Even as he is bowed by grief like 'an oak tree, its trunk warped / By a hundred years and more of wars // and storms'; even as his faith is shaken to its foundations; he reawakens 'In a combustion of butterflies.' Here is sheer lyric inventiveness in the service of feeling. By these poems, your faith will be shattered and restored, restored and wondrously shattered again." Craig Morgan Teicher, author of <i>To Keep Love Blurry</i><br><br>"This is a major work of art. Hopler&#x2019;s vision and voice, both painfully complex because of how much of the world he allows to attach to him, to stake its claim on him, teach us we are in the presence of lasting, inimitable poems. No one writes like Hopler. And no one ever will." Katie Ford, author of <i>Colosseum</i><br><br>"In his second collection of poetry, Jay Hopler&#x2019;s incredible ear and inventiveness with poetic form return full throttle. Even as they engage grief and loss, the poems here are funny and sardonic, not afraid to wear their feelings on their sleeves; they're a tonic."

Too bad about the tumor in his face.<br></b><br> Handsome, impeccably tuxedoed Bruno Alexander travels the world winning large sums of money from amateur "whales" who think they can challenge his peerless acumen at backgammon. Fronted by his pasty, vampiric manager, Edgar Falk, Bruno arrives in Berlin after a troubling run of bad luck in Singapore. Perhaps it was the chance encounter with his crass childhood acquaintance Keith Stolarsky and his smoldering girlfriend Tira Harpaz. Or perhaps it was the emergence of a blot that distorts his vision so he has to look at the board sideways.<br><br> Things don't go much better in Berlin. Bruno's flirtation with Madchen, the striking blonde he meets on the ferry, is inconclusive; the game at the unsettling Herr Kohler's mansion goes awry as his blot grows worse; he passes out and is sent to the local hospital, where he is given an extremely depressing diagnosis. Having run through Falk's money, Bruno turns to Stolarsky, who, for reasons of his own, agrees to fly Bruno to Berkeley, and to pay for the experimental surgery that might save his life.<br><br> Berkeley, where Bruno discovered his psychic abilities, and to which he vowed never to return. Amidst the patchouli flashbacks and Anarchist gambits of the local scene, between Tira's come-ons and Keith's machinations, Bruno confronts two existential questions: Is the gambler being played by life?&nbsp; And what if you're telepathic but it doesn't do you any good?</p><p>JONATHAN LETHEM is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of nine novels, including <i>Dissident Gardens</i>, <i>The Fortress of Solitude</i>, and<i> Motherless Brooklyn</i>; three short story collections; and two essay collections, including <i>The Ecstasy of Influence</i>, which was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist.

Presumably also when he slept. The blot. Standing alone at the back of the sparsely populated ferry to Kladow, mercifully sheltered behind safety glass against the chill of the lake at evening, Alexander Bruno could no longer deny the blot that had swollen in his vision and was with him always, the vacancy now deforming his view of the receding shore. It forced him to peer around its edges for glimpses of the mansions and biergartens, the strip of sand at the century-�old lido, the tarpaulined sailboats. He&#x2019;d come to Berlin, half the circumference of the world, two weeks ago, whether to elude his fate or to embrace it he couldn&#x2019;t know.<br><br>He&#x2019;d been biding his time in Charlottenburg, breakfasting at the quiet caf�s, watching the days grow steadily longer, overhearing more spoken English than he&#x2019;d have preferred, running through his last funds. His tuxedo had remained in its hanging bag, his backgammon case latched. All the while the blot had been with him, unacknowledged. Bruno its carrier, its host. He&#x2019;d passed through customs with the innocence of the accidental smuggler: Nothing to declare. It was only after having at last called the number provided him by Edgar Falk and consenting to visit the rich man&#x2019;s house in Kladow, only upon his waking, this very day on which he&#x2019;d dusted off tuxedo and backgammon case, that the blot had insisted he grant its existence. An old friend he&#x2019;d never met but recognized nevertheless.<br><br>Why get too fancy about it? He might be dying.<br><br>Under the circumstances of Bruno&#x2019;s dread, the slide of the S-�Bahn through the endless roster of stations from Westend to Wannsee had seemed as long as his voyage from Singapore to Berlin. The German city, with its graffiti and construction sites, its desultory strips of parkland and naked pink water pipes, had its own sprawl and circumference. Berlin wended through time. On the S-�Bahn toward Wannsee the tall girls in black leggings with bicycles and earbuds, so prevalent in Charlottenburg and Mitte, had thinned out, replaced by dour Prussian businessmen and staring grandmother types, slouching home with briefcases and shopping bags. By the time of the ferry there was little to defeat the irresistible illusion that the city was newly vanquished and carved into sectors, that the prevailing silence and gloom derived from remorse and privations not seventy years past but fresh as smoldering rubble.<br><br>When Bruno had called to ask his host for directions to Kladow, the rich man told him that the ferry across the lake at evening was an experience he shouldn&#x2019;t miss. Bruno, the German had said, should keep his eye out on the right for the famous Strandbad Wannsee, Berlin&#x2019;s traditional resort beach, and, on the left, for the Wannsee-�Konferenz villa. The site of the Final Solution&#x2019;s planning, though Bruno had needed this legacy explained by his hotel&#x2019;s concierge. Of course, scanning for it now, Bruno had no way of distinguishing the site from other mansions arrayed on the western shore, each of which heaved into the void at the center of his sight.<br><br>For how long had Bruno considered the blot nothing but a retinal floater grown mad or the looming ghost of his inattention? Only a fool wouldn&#x2019;t connect it to the perennial headache that had caused him, as he&#x2019;d walked from the Wannsee S-�Bahnhof through the steep park leading to the boarding dock, to shuffle his fingers into his tuxedo jacket&#x2019;s interior pocket in search of his packet of paracetamol, that incomparable British aspirin on which he&#x2019;d grown dependent. Then to gulp down two pills, with only the shimmering lake before him for water. He&#x2019;d accept the verdict of fool if it meant the paracetamol repaired his sight. Made a full cake of that which was presently a doughnut: the world. He raised his hand. The blot obscured his palm as it had the shore. Bruno noticed he&#x2019;d lost a cuff link.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said. He said it to a tall girl in black tights, one of those who&#x2019;d journeyed in his car of the S-�Bahn, all the way from the fashionable Mitte, to board the ferry. She&#x2019;d maneuvered her bicycle into the ferry&#x2019;s rack before joining him at the back windows. Bruno spoke to excuse crouching at her knees to feel on the floor, on the chance that the cuff link had only tumbled down at his feet. A hopeless impulse, like the drunkard in the joke who, wandering at night on a side street, and discovering he has lost his key, searches not in the place he believes it was lost but instead beneath a lamppost, simply because the light is better there.<br><br>The joke came to mind because the girl crouched to help, without knowing what she was looking for. In the joke, the drunk was aided by a policeman, who searches for a while beneath the streetlamp too. Now, as she bent to join him, Bruno saw that girl wasn&#x2019;t actually the right word. Her lined face was both severe and attractive. So many women in Berlin, athletically slim, dressed in a universal costume and couldn&#x2019;t be judged for age by their outlines.<br><br>&#x201c;Kontaktlinsen?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No . . . no . . .&#x201d; The Berliners all spoke English, and even when they didn&#x2019;t, the meanings bled through. In Singapore the alien tongues of Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil had left him happily sealed in his cone of incomprehension. Did she guess that the problem was with his eyes because he groped like a blind man?<br><br>&#x201c;Kuffenlinksen . . .&#x201d; he bluffed, pinching his loose sleeve. He doubted it was a word in any language. Additionally I am probably also soon losing my life, he added in pidgin telepathy, just to see if she was listening.<br><br>She showed no sign of having read his thoughts. He was relieved. Alexander Bruno had forsaken thought transference years ago, at the start of puberty. Yet he remained vigilant.<br><br>&#x201c;English?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Bruno enjoyed being mistaken for British. With his height and high cheekbones, he&#x2019;d been told he resembled Roger Moore, or the bass player from Duran Duran. More likely, however, she only meant the English language.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve dropped a piece of jewelry. I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t know the word in German. Man jewelry.&#x201d; He displayed his cuff, which was slightly foxed, scorched by hotel-�room ironings. Let her see it. Bruno was aware that his appeal was that of a ruined glamour. His neck and jaw, considered in the mirror lately, were those of the father he&#x2019;d never known. The flesh only tightened over Bruno&#x2019;s chin in the old familiar way if he thrust his jaw forward and tilted his head back slightly, a pose he&#x2019;d recognized as definitive of middle-�aged vanity. He caught himself at it frequently.<br><br>Now he looked not into the mirror but into the face of the �would-be rescuer of his nonexistent contact lens. White hair interspersed with the blond. Enticing lips framed by deep lines&#x2014;�to Bruno, expressive, though they must have bothered her. Two humans beyond their prime, but hanging in. He had to deflect his glance in order to see her at all, likely making him appear more bashful than he felt. &#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I lost it on the train.&#x201d;<br><br>Flirtation, so effortlessly accomplished. Mention of the train had done it. Train unspecified; they both knew which. They&#x2019;d ridden together and now shared the ferry, and though a thousand identical to her might have strolled past his Charlottenburg caf� window in two weeks, the shared destination worked its paltry magic. And both tall. This little was enough to excuse lust as destiny.<br><br>Bruno had imagined a day when he&#x2019;d outgrow distractibility. Instead, approaching fifty, the window of his interest had widened. Women once invisible to his younger self were now etched in flame in his imagination. This wasn&#x2019;t erotic propriety. Bruno was still capable of desiring the younger women who no longer&#x2014;�mostly&#x2014;�returned his glances. But those his own age, their continuing fitness for the animal game newly visible to him, these he found more arresting, for their air of either desperation or total denial. Would he eventually crave the grandmothers too? Perhaps by that time the blot in his sight would have expanded to a general blindness, and so have freed him.<br><br>They stood. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Alexander,&#x201d; he said, and offered his hand. She took it.<br><br>&#x201c;Madchen.&#x201d;<br><br>The question was in what language they&#x2019;d extend their special destiny. English, or . . . ? Not German, since Bruno had none. English or the language of no language, which he preferred. He began slowly and deliberately, but with care not to suggest idiocy on either of their parts. &#x201c;I have an appointment in Kladow. It is at a private home. I am expected alone, but it would surely delight my host if I arrived with you as a guest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;You would like&#x2014;�?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping you&#x2019;ll join me, Madchen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To a dinner, ja? Sorry for my not-�good English.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should be the one to apologize. I&#x2019;m the visitor in your country. It&#x2019;s not a dinner exactly. An . . . appointment.&#x201d; He raised his back�gammon case slightly. If she took it for a briefcase, she wasn&#x2019;t precisely wrong. The tools of his trade. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s sure to be something to eat, if you&#x2019;re hungry. Or we can go out after.&#x201d;<br><br>I will never lie to you, he promised silently, again just in case she could hear. Bruno had only encountered a small scattering of those in whom he observed the gift of telepathy he himself had renounced. But you never knew.<br><br>&#x201c;It is very nice, what you ask, but I think I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be completely welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If it is your work?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a gambler,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You would be my good-�luck charm.&#x201d; Steadi�ness and poise, these were Bruno&#x2019;s old methods. He wasn&#x2019;t going to let the blot make him squirrelly.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t speak but smiled again, confused.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re beautiful,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>They should have had a bar on this ferry, and an ocean for the ferry to cross. Instead the voyage was concluding. The boat had curled around a small island, into the landing at Kladow. The passengers bunched at the doors.<br><br>&#x201c;Or, afterward,&#x201d; he conceded. &#x201c;I could call you when I&#x2019;m finished.&#x201d; He gestured at the twilit town beyond the ferry dock. &#x201c;Have you a favorite place for a late drink?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In Kladow?&#x201d; Madchen seemed to find this funny. She raised her bicycle&#x2019;s front wheel to free it from the rack.<br><br>He drew his phone from his tux&#x2019;s interior breast pocket. &#x201c;Will you give me your number?&#x201d;<br><br>She raised her eyebrows, glanced to one side. Then took his phone from him and, scowling intently, keyed a string of numbers into the device and returned it to him. The ferry emptied quickly. They brought up the rear, shuffling out along the short pier where others now queued for the return crossing. Under the Kladow docks, a family of swans bobbed together. Farther from the boats, he saw a diving cormorant. The bird called Bruno to some memory he couldn&#x2019;t quite retrieve . . .<br><br>He scanned the near shore for the car the rich man had promised to send. The view confirmed the ferry&#x2019;s power as a time machine, one which had transported them from the fashionable Mitte, the urbane international Berlin of present reputation. Alt-�Kladow stood clustered uphill, a sleepy nineteenth-�century village. Perhaps it was here German life truly resided, fires banked against history. Bruno might understand Madchen&#x2019;s amusement at the suggestion of a late drink now. Though the shorefront was strewn with cozy biergartens, he&#x2019;d be surprised if they remained open much past sundown on a �Wed�nesday. The crowd from the ferry lowered their heads and trudged past the biergartens&#x2019; wooden-�bower entrances, hell-�bent for domestic finish lines.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you live here?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She shook her head. &#x201c;I come to do . . . kindersitting. For my sis�ter&#x2019;s girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your niece.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>They crossed the street, Madchen wheeling her bicycle by her side. They passed a workman who knelt in a scattering of loose squarish stones, which he pounded with a large block hammer into the familiar grid pattern that made up Berlin&#x2019;s sidewalks. Bruno had never seen the stones dislodged from the ground until now. They seemed a reminder to him of his trade, his purpose here. Berlin was paved with unnumbered dice, smashed flush to the ground with wooden mallets.<br><br>As the few vehicles meeting the ferry departed, and the crowd of walkers filtered up the hill, Bruno spotted the car he&#x2019;d expected, the car the rich man had sent for him. A Mercedes-�Benz, two decades old but impeccable. Another output of the time machine. The driver, crew cut and thick of neck, examined Bruno, who would have fit the description he&#x2019;d provided the rich man, except for the presence of his companion. Bruno held up one finger, and the driver nodded and rolled up his window. Madchen followed his glance.<br><br>&#x201c;Madchen&#x2014;�&#x201d; He took the tip of her chin gently between his thumb and forefinger, as if adjusting a framed picture slightly skewed on a wall. The nearer he brought her face to his, the less the blot mattered. As if he&#x2019;d invited her in, behind its curtain. &#x201c;One kiss, for luck.&#x201d;<br><br>Her eyes closed as he leaned in and brushed her lips with his. Bruno felt a surprising numbness in his lips. He hadn&#x2019;t noticed feeling cold. You have been kissed, Madchen, by a vision in a tuxedo. Albeit one not so well preserved as the car that had come to collect him.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call when I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d; He thought of his earlier promise. One enforced the other.<br><br>Madchen drew back and shed a last curious smile, then slid onto her bicycle and was gone, into the center of his blot and up the hill. By the time Bruno entered the backseat of the waiting car, she wasn&#x2019;t to be seen. He glanced once more shoreward, at the jostling swans, the bobbing fearless cormorant, then nodded to the driver. The Benz crawled up the same road she&#x2019;d taken, the only route into Alt-�Kladow.</p><h2>King of the Holly Hop: A Milan Jacovich Mystery</h2><p>#14 in the Milan Jacovich mystery series . . .<br>Going to your high school reunion is never fun.

First, you&#x2019;re surprised some of the people you were sure would be there are missing. They&#x2019;ve either moved far away, or they have no desire to join the reunion. Second, you&#x2019;re surprised some of those you never dreamed would attend actually show up. </p> <p>Third: you find yourself there too.</p> <p>The weekend of my fortieth high school reunion&#x2015;dear old St. Clair High School in the St. Clair&#x2013;Superior corridor on the near East Side of Cleveland&#x2015;was to begin on a Friday evening in February. February is a singularly lousy time to have a reunion, but I found later that the hotel had been booked way in advance during the more pleasant spring and summer months. I carefully chose my wardrobe for the evening, and had left it hanging in my office closet all day&#x2015;the one just across the Cuyahoga River from downtown Cleveland in an old building I&#x2019;d purchased several years earlier with a bequest from an elderly aunt. Checking myself out in my bathroom mirror, I thought my black wool blazer looked nifty, even on somebody as big as I am, and I donned it for the cocktail party with gray slacks, a darker gray shirt, and a muted red-and-gray necktie. Then finally I girded my loins and drove across the river to the Crowne Plaza Centre Hotel downtown.</p> <p>I stepped off the elevator into an alternate universe in which everyone wore plastic-covered name badges. The men were consciously pulling in their tummies as the women strove equally hard to flaunt what remained of their girlish figures. Some faces rang distant bells for me, and in my mind I attempted to de-age them, imagining how they looked when they were seventeen.</p> <p>A few people nodded at me as they strove mightily to remember my name. A few waved or smiled insincerely, and I&#x2019;d bet they didn&#x2019;t recognize me, either. One man I didn&#x2019;t remember, now a heavyset bald guy wearing a checked sports jacket, looked at me and whispered something to his wife, covering his mouth with his hand like a wicked plotter in the court of the Venetian doge. I hadn&#x2019;t the vaguest idea what he was saying about me. Until I registered, I wasn&#x2019;t &#x201c;official,&#x201d; and no one would speak to me.</p> <p>The woman sitting sentry under a welcome banner with our class year emblazoned on it wore a short, perky haircut and what looked like a strapless 1954 prom frock made of gingham, with a huge matching bow over one of her generous breasts. I recalled neither the name nor the cleavage.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hi-i-i-i,&#x201d; she said with an upward inflection, and rose to shake my hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Gerry Gabrosek. Remember?&#x201d;</p> <p>The name tag identified her as Geraldine Gabrosek Bokar. I recalled her then&#x2015;an indefatigable girl who always served on the dance committee, the senior picnic committee, the prom committee&#x2015;and she&#x2019;d been president of the French club, and in the hostess club too. She&#x2019;d always organized her own social life, and most of her girlfriends&#x2019; lives, too.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Milan Jacovich,&#x201d; I told her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Everybody knows who you are&#x2015;the private detective. You&#x2019;re famous.&#x201d; She leaned over the table to press her cheek to mine, and strong perfume wafted up from the valley between her bosoms like swamp gas. I didn&#x2019;t bother telling her that &#x201c;detective&#x201d; is a police rank, and that I&#x2019;m actually a private investigator.</p> <p>She fluttered on for a while and then gave me my name badge, a schedule for the weekend, info sheets I never got around to reading, a biography sheet with paragraphs about everyone attending, my Saturday night dinner ticket with table number affixed, and a complimentary drink coupon.</p> <p>One complimentary drink. Subsequent drinks I&#x2019;d have to pay for. It was boding to be a long damn night.</p> <p>I pinned my badge to my jacket and made my way into the main room. There must have been two hundred classmates and spouses in there. Some, who&#x2019;d stayed in the lower echelons of the labor force like their immigrant parents, looked stiff and awkward in their dress-up clothes. Others seemed at ease, smiling and aggressively sociable. Lots of hugs and handshakes and manly backslaps going on, and air kisses galore. The gathering was an emotional clusterfuck.</p> <p>The attire of some seemed a part of their anatomy and the confident way they held themselves, as if they went to parties like this every week. They knew exactly what to do, how loud to talk, and just how to hold their drinks in one hand while trying to consume hors d&#x2019;oeuvres. They&#x2019;d come to the reunion to strut and preen; they claimed bragging rights.</p> <p>Then there was Gary Mishlove, a microscope geek who had publicly vomited in junior year chemistry lab while performing an experiment with spoiled milk that had stunk up the whole second floor for a week. He&#x2019;d always been a short, chunky guy and I recognized his face almost immediately, but his body had acquired an extra two hundred pounds and he was now dangerously obese.</p> <p>Gary was talking to Maurice Paich, the school&#x2019;s favorite actor. How he ever survived in a tough neighborhood with an interest in acting and hauling around a moniker like Maurice, I&#x2019;ll never know&#x2015;but he wound up as a radio announcer for a local station. At his side his wife, a pretty, brilliant blonde whose name, I learned from a quick peek at the bios, was Meredith, was casing the room and inspecting everyone except her husband, and seemed to have an early start on an evening&#x2019;s heavy drinking.</p> <p>I was surprised Stupan Godic had bothered attending. From an immigrant family like mine, he&#x2019;d returned from the draft after serving in Southeast Asia, damaged and embittered, and spent the next thirty-five years sunk in heavy drug use. He was medium height and still very skinny. In a wrinkled sports jacket over a blue denim shirt with collar and cuffs hopelessly frayed, he wore a half-angry and half-dreamy expression. He was lost in the traumatic events of the seventies and unready to step forward into the twenty-first century. We talked for a minute and then he shuffled away, carrying his war memories with him around his shoulders.</p> <p>I made my way to the bar. The bartender, young enough to be the offspring of anyone in the room, poured me a Jack Daniels on the rocks and took away my complimentary drink ticket.</p> <p>A big-eyed woman approached me, dragging her reluctant husband behind her like a kid accompanying his mom on a shopping spree. Her hair was pulled back into a severe bun, framing a Modigliani face. I recalled the smile but nothing more. Arlene, Eileen, Elaine&#x2015;I couldn&#x2019;t quite pick out the right name.</p> <p>&#x201c;Milan Jacovich,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;how fantastic to see you again.&#x201d; She at least remembered how to pronounce my name; it&#x2019;s My-lan, accent on the first syllable&#x2015;not Mee-lahn or Mi-lahn&#x2015;and the surname is pronounced with a Y, not a J, as in Yock-o-vitch. She embraced me warmly, putting her soft cheek against mine, kicking in at least one memory. Somewhere, forty years ago, for some reason I didn&#x2019;t recall, I&#x2019;d kissed her. &#x201c;Ilene Silver. Remember?&#x201d;</p> <p>I confirmed the spelling on her name badge. Ilene. I&#x2019;d been close, anyway.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ilene Seltzer now. This is my husband, Toby.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ilene Silver to Ilene Seltzer&#x2015;she didn&#x2019;t have to change monograms on the towels. Ilene told me they had two children, and that Toby was CEO of an engineering firm in Broadview Heights, in the western suburbs. Losing interest quickly, I flatlined after the third sentence, smiling and nodding and not listening to a thing.</p> <p>Then something over her shoulder caught her attention. &#x201c;Ooooh!&#x201d; she squealed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Tommy Wiggins.&#x201d; And without so much as a &#x201c;See ya,&#x201d; she powered toward our school&#x2019;s real celebrity alumnus.</p> <p>Tommy Wiggins had grown taller since I&#x2019;d known him. He was now just under six feet, slimmed down a lot, his full head of hair generously sprinkled with silver. Fame had taught him to wear his charisma well&#x2015;it hovered around his head like a nimbus. Classmates roared toward him like linebackers determined to sack the quarterback, clamoring to bask in a small sliver of his angel shine.</p> <p>Clevelanders aren&#x2019;t impressed with celebrities, except for the ones who wear their jockstraps to work, like LeBron James. Local TV personalities get nodded to, but are rarely bothered. However, all my former classmates seemed to feel a certain proprietary interest in Tommy Wiggins because he&#x2019;d gone on to famous things. In high school, he&#x2019;d been shy and slightly pudgy and very dreamy, interested in what were perceived to be arcane and not very manly subjects like art and theater. He&#x2019;d gone to college in central Ohio, majoring in creative writing. When he moved to New York, seven of his plays were produced on Broadway&#x2015;six of them smash-hit comedies. He&#x2019;d won two Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, and when they made his work into movies, he&#x2019;d earned two Oscar nominations for the screenplays. He was a big shot in both New York, where he lived, and in Los Angeles, where he kept a condo, and he frequently made the tabloid press as he married and divorced twice. His second wife was a sexpot movie actress nearly thirty years his junior, and he had been linked to other women even more famous. He&#x2019;d attained a success most Clevelanders only dream about, and that&#x2019;s why all his former school chums were fawning all over him.</p> <p>I stopped to talk for a while with high school sweethearts who had made it permanent the year they both graduated from high school. August Turkman&#x2015;we called him Augie&#x2015;had gone to work in his father&#x2019;s dry-cleaning store in Maple Heights and married Amalia Zelka six months later. Now Augie owns that dry-cleaning store and two others, and after forty years of marriage they both still looked happy. That was nice, I thought, even when Amalia told me they&#x2019;d moved to a much bigger house in Maple Heights and now raise Welsh corgis.</p> <p>&#x201c;Bitsy&#x201d; Steinberg&#x2015;now Elizabeth Steinberg Miller&#x2015;came over to greet me. She had the grace to admit we had never spoken in school, but she said she&#x2019;d always enjoyed watching me play football, and introduced her husband, who owned a local chain of pool-and-patio stores and who frequently popped up on his company&#x2019;s commercials, talking too loudly.</p> <p>I wandered the room, free drink in hand, encountering familiar faces. Men whose hands I&#x2019;d never shaken hugged me like long-lost war buddies, and women were hell bent to kiss my cheek. Most were virtual strangers to me, but we shared a history of sorts. A snapped towel in the locker room, a copped feel under the bleachers, sweating out tests together, quietly hoping for the future&#x2015;memories conveniently forgotten, but not diluted by time as it tumbles by.</p> <p>Then Lila Coso Jacovich entered on the arm of her longtime consort, Joe Bradac, looking spectacular in a black cocktail dress that hugged the swell of her breasts. Her hemline ended two inches above her still-shapely knees. Joe, who owned a machine shop and virtually lived in service overalls, had actually shown up in a suit. It&#x2019;s the only suit I&#x2019;d ever seen him wear that didn&#x2019;t make him look like a wholesale chicken salesman.</p> <p>I found my way back to the bar and ordered another Black Jack. This time I had to pay for it.</p> <p>I carry no torch for my ex-wife. Our split-up&#x2015;all her idea, by the way&#x2015;hit me hard at the time. By now, though, we&#x2019;d been divorced longer than we&#x2019;d been married, and had moved on. Whatever residual issues remained between Joe Bradac and me existed only in his head, not mine. I belted down half my drink and shouldered my way through the crowd to where they stood. Lila surveyed the room like a reigning queen, but Joe blinked uncertainly as he watched my approach the way a deer in shock regards an oncoming semi on the highway.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lila, you look beautiful,&#x201d; I said, bending to kiss her cheek. We never kissed anymore, not even cheeks, but everyone else at the reunion was doing so and it would have shouted tension had we not.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t shake Joe&#x2019;s hand; I never did. He was always frightened that I&#x2019;d crush it into jelly. It had eaten a hole in my liver that Lila secretly cheated with and then finally discarded me for someone like him, but Joe is exactly the kind of man Lila needs&#x2015;one she can dominate and push around at will. Say what you will about me, then and now, nobody has ever pushed me around.</p> <p>If they do, I push back.</p> <p>So I was happy to be long gone from a home where major arguments occurred twice a week, at least one of them invariably on a Sunday. I still have feelings for Lila because she&#x2019;s the mother of my two sons, but each time I see her it reminds me why we aren&#x2019;t together anymore.</p> <p>I disengaged myself from the happy couple and stood off to one side, wishing I&#x2019;d skipped the reunion altogether, when my attention was caught by a guy whose name I don&#x2019;t think I ever heard, even though I remembered him from St. Clair. In his youth his face was like a tomahawk, all sharp, brutal angles, and years hadn&#x2019;t softened it. Now he wore his black hair combed straight back and slicked down, sporting a mustache that drooped at the ends.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d tried out for high school football, I remembered, and during the scrimmage&#x2015;he&#x2019;d hoped to become a running back&#x2015;he kicked one of the tacklers right in the stones at the moment of contact. About five minutes later, when he was taken down hard by one of the linebackers, he gouged the kid&#x2019;s eye with his thumb, causing some pretty scary bleeding. I never got his name and hardly ever saw him around after the coach told him to get lost. He was too far away for me to read his name badge so I could look up his bio. He might be a Baptist minister now, or a vacuum cleaner repairman, but he looked like a hired assassin.</p> <p>The crowd had finally drifted away from Tommy Wiggins, and he headed straight to the bar for fortification. I came up beside him and reintroduced myself.</p> <p>&#x201c;I remember you, Milan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You played football, didn&#x2019;t you? As I recall, you were always very nice to me. I remember things like that.&#x201d; His smile seemed more genuine than the one pasted on when everyone swarmed around him, hoping to touch him. His hair was longer than that of most men his age who still had theirs, but he didn&#x2019;t need a haircut at all&#x2015;the length had been cultivated for a more artistic look, and his golden skin proclaimed the gentle all-over tan of a New York tanning salon. He&#x2019;d grown a lot more handsome in the forty years since senior class, but he didn&#x2019;t carry himself as though he knew it. He seemed more relaxed with me than with the reunioners who&#x2019;d slobbered all over him, and I gathered he was always immensely comfortable in his own milieu.</p> <p>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ve changed some,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but you haven&#x2019;t at all&#x2015;except you had more hair when we were seventeen.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You wear success well, Tom. Congratulations.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t kid yourself.&#x201d; He accepted a martini on the rocks from the bartender, took a sip, and jiggled the glass a little so the ice cubes clinked. &#x201c;Every writer I know&#x2015;Oscars and Tonys and Pulitzers notwithstanding&#x2015;is terrified that he&#x2019;s taken his last good shot, done his last good work, and his next effort is going to fall loudly on its ass in front of God and everybody else.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yours won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll always have something interesting to write about because you lead such a fascinating life.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Writers don&#x2019;t have adventures. We just observe them.

It is nothing short of remarkable that Child is not only able to continually reinvent his ex-military cop, but that each installment is better than the last. <em>Worth Dying For</em> finds our battered hero hiding in plain sight in a tiny Nebraska town, trying to recover from the catastrophe he left behind in South Dakota (no spoilers here, but readers are still arguing over <em>61 Hours</em>&#x2019;s cliffhanger ending). Fans rarely see such a physically vulnerable Reacher (in the first part of the book he is barely able to lift his arms) but it just adds to the fist-pumping satisfaction of seeing our weary good guy take on the small-town baddies. --<em>Daphne Durham</em><b>Lee Child</b> is the author of fifteen Jack Reacher thrillers, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers<i> Persuader, The Enemy, One Shot,</i> and <i>The Hard Way,</i> and the #1 bestsellers 6<i>1 Hours, Gone Tomorrow, Bad Luck and Trouble,</i> and <i>Nothing to Lose</i>. His debut,<i> Killing Floor,</i> won both the Anthony and the Barry awards for Best First Mystery, and <i>The Enemy</i> won both the Barry and Nero awards for Best Novel.

Shackleton's life is traced from his early childhood to his death en route to another Antarctic voyage. Readers learn how he went to sea at an early age, and how his hunger for adventure and interest in exploring developed. It is not surprising that the author devotes a great deal of attention to Shackleton's Endurance expedition. Unfortunately, that amazing story has already been told several times in more compelling narratives, most notably in Jennifer Armstrong's Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World (Crown, 1998). The stunning, archival black-and-white photographs are this book's strength, but there is little new information here. Libraries already owning other books on Shackleton and the Endurance may also want to have this one as a starting place for readers. It tells enough about the man and his adventures to whet the appetite for deeper reading on the subject.<br><i>Edward Sullivan, New York Public Library </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kostyal has written a tight, bracing biography of the renowned Antarctic explorer, illustrated with dramatic black-and-white photographs. Shackleton, a man whose sense of romance and adventure repeatedly drew him from conventional British society to Antarctica (``that lonely, windswept desert of ice and snow at the bottom of the world''), succeeded neither in reaching the South Pole nor traversing the continent, but he exhibited such remarkable valor that, according to the author, his name has become ``synonymous with bravery and endurance.'' As usual, there is more about his expeditions than the man, but Kostyal renders the tale in vivid prose that is enhanced by maps, quotes, a timeline and some remarkable photographs. This quality book will be a useful addition in both home and school libraries. (map, chronology, index) (Biography. 8-10) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Associated for many years with the RAND Corporation, he was the founding director of the first independent &#x201c;think tank,&#x201d; the Hudson Institute. Among his many books are <em>Thinking About the Unthinkable, The Year 2000, The Next 200 Years, The Coming Boom</em>, <em>The Resourceful Earth</em>, and <em>On Thermonuclear War</em>.</p><p> "On Thermonuclear War was controversial when it was first published-and still is, today. No light reading, at well over 600 pages it packs in details from across disciplines and was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain: today its many insights on military strategies, issues, and the logic of amassing thermonuclear armaments still apply.

The Florida land boom, the operations of Insull, Kreuger and Hatry, and the Shandoah Corporation all come together in Galbraith&#39;s study of concerted human greed and folly.</p><p>Rampant speculation. Record trading volumes. Assets bought not because of their value but because the buyer believes he can sell them for more in a day or two, or an hour or two. Welcome to the late 1920s. There are obvious and absolute parallels to the great bull market of the late 1990s, writes Galbraith in a new introduction dated 1997. Of course, Galbraith notes, every financial bubble since 1929 has been compared to the Great Crash, which is why this book has never been out of print since it became a bestseller in 1955.<p> Galbraith writes with great wit and erudition about the perilous actions of investors, and the curious inaction of the government. He notes that the problem wasn't a scarcity of securities to buy and sell; "the ingenuity and zeal with which companies were devised in which securities might be sold was as remarkable as anything." Those words become strikingly relevant in light of revenue-negative start-up companies coming into the market each week in the 1990s, along with fragmented pieces of established companies, like real estate and bottling plants. Of course, the 1920s were different from the 1990s. There was no safety net below citizens, no unemployment insurance or Social Security. And today we don't have the creepy investment trusts--in which shares of companies that held some stocks and bonds were sold for several times the assets' market value. But, boy, are the similarities spooky, particularly the prevailing trend at the time toward corporate mergers and industry consolidations--not to mention all the partially informed people who imagined themselves to be financial geniuses because the shares of stock they bought kept going up. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Previous ISBN 978-0-395-85999-5</p><h2>The Revolution Business: Book Five of the Merchant Princes</h2><p><p>Things are going badly for the Clan in this SF novel of the Merchant Princes, the immensely popular series by Charles Stross. Locked in a vicious civil war for control over the kingdom of Niejwein, their army is bottled up inside a fortress under siege in two parallel universes at once. Duke Angbard, the Clan's leader, has been laid low by a stroke: plotters are already conspiring in readiness for the deadly dance to come.</p><p>Miriam, rescued from a tight spot in New Britain, finds the hopes of the young, progressive faction focused on her. But do they want her as a leader or a figurehead? She soon finds herself thrown into a desperate struggle for power. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the Clan, researchers working for the US government have achieved a technological breakthrough.</p></p><p><b>Charles Stross</b> is the author of the bestselling Merchant Princes series, the Laundry series, and several stand-alone novels including <i>Glasshouse</i>, <i>Accelerando</i>, and <i>Saturn's Children</i>. Born in Leeds, England, in 1964, Stross studied in London and Bradford, earning degrees in pharmacy and computer science. Over the next decade and a half he worked as a pharmacist, a technical writer, a software engineer, and eventually as a prolific journalist covering the IT industry. His short fiction began attracting wide attention in the late 1990s; his first novel, <i>Singularity Sky</i>, appeared in 2003. He has subsequently won the Hugo Award twice. He lives with his wife in Edinburgh, Scotland, in a flat that is slightly older than the state of Texas.<p>Chapter One</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Heir Apparent</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I am not hearing this, Miriam Beckstein told herself. The temptation to giggle, to laugh it all off as a bizarre joke, was enormous. Pretend it isn&#x2019;t happening; yeah, right. Story of my life. She tightened her grip on the valise holding her notebook PC and its precious CD- ROMs. Except that for the past six months, the mad stuff had made a habit of punching her in the guts whenever she least expected it. &#x201c;Run that by me again,&#x201d; she said. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s quite simple,&#x201d; said the hard- eyed young debutante with the machine pistol. &#x201c;Your mother wants to use you to consolidate power.&#x201d; She kept her eyes focused on Miriam as she twisted the magazine free of the gun, worked a slide to eject a cartridge, and swapped another magazine into place. &#x201c;The duke agrees with her. And we&#x201d;&#x2014;the eloquent roll of her shoulder took in their companions, a cohort of young and alarmingly heavily armed Clan world- walkers&#x2014;&#x201d;intend to make sure you&#x2019;re not just there for show.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>They look like students, thought Miriam. Students outfitted by North Face for a weekend hike; accessories by Fabrique Nationale and Heckler &amp; Koch. Of course they were nothing of the kind. Young aristocrats of the Clan nobility&#x2014;born in the curious quasi- mediaeval kingdom of Gruinmarkt, and able to travel to other worlds at will&#x2014;they might look like ordinary American undergrads, but the mind- set behind those fresh young faces was very different. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; she managed. The idea of her mother&#x2014;and the duke&#x2014;plotting to put her on the throne of the Gruinmarkt was pretty preposterous, on the face of it&#x2014;but then, so were so many of the other intrigues the Clan seemed to generate. Then another thought struck her: You said &#x201c;we,&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t you? So Brill had an agenda of her own, over and above her loyalty to the duke&#x2014;or Miriam, for that matter? Time to probe.... </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Was this&#x201d;&#x2014;she pointed at her belly, quiet anger in her voice&#x2014;&#x201d;part of their plan?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Milady&#x201d; Brill&#x2014;Lady Brilliana d&#x2019;Ost, a mere twenty- something&#x2014;furrowed her brow. &#x201c;With all due respect, if you think that, you&#x2019;re paranoid. Do you really think the duke&#x2014;or your mother&#x2014;know you so poorly as to think you a suitable mother for the heir to the throne? Much less, under such durance? Henryk and your&#x2014;his backer&#x2014;were fools for thinking they could manipulate you that way, and now they are dead fools. The rest of us are just trying to make the best of a bad deal. And if you want to talk politics, would you mind leaving it until later? I&#x2019;ve got a splitting headache and it&#x2019;s about to get worse.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Miriam winced. World- walking took it out of a member of the Clan&#x2019;s inner families, those with the ability: Doing it more than once in a day risked migrainelike symptoms and a blood pressure spike. There were other symptoms, too: pregnancy, she&#x2019;d learned the hard way, made world- walking under your own power impossible. But they&#x2019;d come here from New Britain, escaping after the abortive ambush at a provincial railway station in that world&#x2019;s version of California, immediately after picking her up. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the young men pacing the perimeter of the clearing raised a hand, twirled it in a warning circle. &#x201c;One hour to go.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Yah.&#x201d; Brill glanced round again. The forest clearing was peaceful, unoccupied but for Miriam, Brill, and her three young bloods, but she never stopped scanning. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Are we in any immediate danger?&#x201d; Miriam asked, shifting her balance on the fallen tree trunk. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Probably not right now.&#x201d; Brill paused to continue her inspection. &#x201c;The Kao&#x2019;s patrols don&#x2019;t usually sweep this far northeast. Better not linger, though. We&#x2019;ll be ready to move in another hour.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;The Kao?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;The Favored of Heaven&#x2019;s border troops. Most of the local tribes give them a wide berth. We should, too.&#x201d; A warning look in her eyes gave Miriam a cold shiver; if Brill was scared of them, that was enough for her. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;What are you planning on doing once we cross over?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a hotel suite in San Jose. I plan to get us over there, then make contact with the duke and ask for further instructions. I imagine he&#x2019;ll want us back on the east coast stat&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve got a biz- jet standing by. Otherwise, we&#x2019;ll do what Security tells us to do. Unless you have other plans?&#x201d; Brill raised a carefully shaped eyebrow. Even though she&#x2019;d started the day with a brisk firefight, then a forced crossing into wilderness, she&#x2019;d taken pains with her makeup. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Miriam shrugged. &#x201c;I thought I did.&#x201d; Her hands were restless; trying to keep them still, she thrust them deep in the pockets of her overly heavy coat. &#x201c;The political situation in New Britain is going to hell in a handbasket. Erasmus was on his way to meet a big wheel in the, uh, resistance.&#x201d; In point of fact, the biggest wheel in the underground, returning from exile after a generation&#x2014;to whom he had once been a personal assistant. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too hot for comfort. I was only going along because I couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else to do; when I fetched up in London all I had was the clothes on my back.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Well, at least you got away from the mess at the Summer Palace with your skin intact,&#x201d; Brill observed. &#x201c;And thank what- ever gods you believe in for that.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>She fell silent for a few minutes. But finally Miriam&#x2019;s curiosity got the better of her. &#x201c;I can guess how you tracked me down,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But what about Huw? And the other two? Who are they? You said something about a job I&#x2019;d suggested, but I don&#x2019;t recall... and they don&#x2019;t look like Uncle Angbard&#x2019;s little helpers to me.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not.&#x201d; Brilliana&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;I just called in help and head office sent them along. Hey! Sir Huw? Have you a minute?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Huw nodded. &#x201c;Bro, cover for me,&#x201d; he told the tall, heavily built guy with the semiauto shotgun as he walked towards them. Huw was anything but husky: skinny and intense. &#x201c;Has something come up?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Huw.&#x201d; Brill smiled, oddly cheerful. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a couple of hours to kill. Why don&#x2019;t you tell her grace what you found?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Her grace? But I&#x2019;m not a duchess. Miriam blinked. Suddenly bits of the big picture were falling into place. Heir to the throne. &#x201c;What you found, where?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re calling it world four right now, but I think a better name for it would be Transition A&#x2013;B,&#x201d; Huw said as he sat down at the far end of the fallen trunk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s where you go if you use the Hidden Family&#x2019;s knotwork as a focus in your world, uh, the United States.&#x201d; He grinned, twitchily. &#x201c;Nobody was able to cross over in New En gland because, well, it&#x2019;s probably under an ice sheet&#x2014;the weather there&#x2019;s definitely a lot colder than in any of the other time lines we know about.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hang on, time lines&#x2014;Miriam held up a hand. &#x201c;What were you doing?&#x201d; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;The duke tasked me with setting up a systematic exploration program,&#x201d; Huw explained. &#x201c;So I started by taking the second known knotwork design and seeing where it&#x2019;d take you if you used it in world two, in the USA, which the Hidden Family had no access to.

Written in a personal, anecdotal style, yet well documented, this book is particularly successful in the chapters that focus on the nuts and bolts of union activities (collective bargaining, structures, organizing), an area largely ignored by current business and political literature.

Carlson, Linda Grant, and Ralph McInerny</p><p>There is a surprising, and refreshing, variety to the 13 stories in this third in a series of mystery short story collections (previous volumes were edited by Elizabeth Peters and Mary Higgins Clark). Some situations here are well beyond Miss Marple's ken: take Susan and Bill Albert's story, in which townspeople, many with car phones, witness a crime and solve it together on a call-in talk-radio show. In Nancy Pickard's offering, crooks rely on a university's sign language-using gorilla as a witness and alibi. The stories by Taylor McCafferty and Deborah Adams each end with an appropriately ironic twist. Dorothy Cannell contributes a hilarious, if overdone, send-up of Jane Austen, the Brontes and lesser period romance writers. Sharyn McCrumb's epistolary "Gentle Reader" is well-written except for the too-cute inclusion of her and other current mystery writers' names on a panel with her fictional author. Some of the stories leave interesting characters undeveloped, and two (Wendy Hornsby's "High Heels in the Headliner" and Camilla T. Crespi's "The Trouble with the Shoot") seem to stretch the definition of what makes a "cozy." Marilyn Wallace submits a brooding, suspenseful and ambiguous tale of trust and suspicion within a marriage, but in the end it's a letdown.

Summer reading at its finest!</b> <p> When Caroline Marris joins her sisters, Gracie Gold and Sam Carter for a Nantucket Island getaway, she has no idea how it will change her life. The sisters stumble upon Misty Harbor Inn, the place their late mother loved so much, and Caroline talks her sisters into buying the beautiful but dilapidated inn. But can free-spirited Caroline stay focused enough to make opening the inn a reality? Hand-drawn old postcards draw the sisters into the mystery of Hannah Montague, the young widow of the original owner. Can the sisters uncover the fate of this woman who disappeared in 1880? As Caroline and her sisters work together to make their mom's dream a reality, they bond in ways they never expected. </p><p> Readers will delight in the inviting setting and be enthralled by the adventures of these sisters who reunite to bring their mother's Misty Harbor dreams to life.</p></p><p><b>Evangeline Kelley</b> is the pen name for the writing team of Patti Berg, Pam Hanson &amp; Barbara Andrews, and Camy Tang, the four authors who collaborated to create Postcards from Misty Harbor Inn.

Forty-one works ranging from an Aboriginal bark painting to a slick Lichtenstein homage to Van Gogh's Arles bedroom are skillfully arranged in two-page "exhibits," with brief suggestions on how to approach them. "Let's Play" shows a Bruegel village scene in which peasant children play such games as "rolling hoops" and "riding a hobbyhorse," followed by a colorful Japanese woodblock print in which youngsters from a different time and place enjoy similar pastimes. In both pictures, readers are asked to find small highlighted details. But this title goes beyond the Waldoesque object-hunting of the earlier books. All five senses are brought into play. Readers are urged to imitate the sounds, interpret the costumes, adapt the patterns, and act out the stories of rich and exciting images from European, Japanese, Persian, and Native American art. Micklethwait teaches basic art concepts and pre-reading skills such as prediction and discrimination, but more importantly, the joy of interactive reading. The book's coffee-table size may pose shelving problems but is justified by the high-quality reproductions and the necessary white space separating the pictures and spare text. A final section lists pictures by title, description, artist, date, country, medium, size, and location of the original. The introductory notes are reassuring and inspiring, and the table of contents is illustrated with tantalizing details from the pages to follow.<br><i>Karen MacDonald, East Falmouth Branch Library, MA</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.As is true of her previous books, Micklethwait (I Spy a Freight Train, p. 902, etc.) begins with the premise that art is accessible to everyone. By asking simple questions and playing easy matching games, readers learn to identify basic emotions and messages that are communicated through the universal language of images. Viewers are asked to find the hoop players in both Brueghel's ``Children's Games'' and a Japanese print of the same name, or to compare van Gogh's ``Bedroom at Arles'' with Lichtenstein's later rendition of the same room. Emotions, faces, smells, and animal noises are some of the ways Micklethwait invites children into these works of art. The color reproductions are excellent; a large format and roomy design allow readers to explore the paintings in detail. Included are well-known works and less familiar ones, with an emphasis on Western art. The most significant segment may be when readers are asked to make up their own stories of what's going on in several paintings. The stories behind the paintings are included, but the message is that what readers see in a painting has validity, that art need not be an elite subject.

The flighty Regina lands on their doorstep with a baby no one knew she was expecting, then disappears a few hours later leaving both the baby and her husband's brutally murdered corpse in her wake. Roe and Martin must try to answer all the questions in this sticky case: whodunnit, why, and where (as in, Where the heck did this baby come from?).

Within the next 24 hours, Regina has disappeared, with her car but without her clothes or her baby; and her ne'er-do-well husband Craig has been found, a hatchet through his head, on the stairs leading to their garage apartment. Then his best friend and former jailmate Rory also turns up, appearing stunned by Craig's death. It's soon decided that Hayden will have to be brought back to Corinth, Ohio, where Martin grew up and where there are relatives who might take the baby in. Martin owns an old, refurbished farmhouse on the outskirts of town where Craig and Regina had been living. Now, he and Roe can stay there until matters are settled. Once arrived, Roe struggles with the complex details of child care as she and Martin try to find the reason for Regina's disappearance and a permanent home for the baby. Their neighbors Margaret and Luke Granberry try to be helpful, but Martin's sister Barby is off on a cruise and other possibilities for Hayden's care seem nonexistent.

"Normal people" can easily make themselves feel as happy as they want to feel any time they choose to so so. That fact was first stated this way in Proverbs 15:23: "People have joy from the answers of their mouths". Then again in Proverbs 23:17: "As people sincerely believe, so will they emeotionally feel". But, as it warns you in Galatians 6:3: "If you believe something that is not a fact, you deceive yourself". That is why this book gives you a fast, easy way to follow this ancient advice first given in Thessalonians 5:21: "Prove all things to yourself and hold fast to that which is good". Those are four of the oldest, yet best medically proven and instantly helpful laws of emotional self-help. <p>This guide gives you exciting, real case examples that reveal how easily and quickly you can use those laws of normal human nature to Help Yourself to as much Happiness as you are willing to have, at any time, in any situation of your life.</p></p><p>Dr. Maxie C. Maultsby Jr. is a most unusual psychiatrist; he is a normal people psychiatrist. That means he is a fully trained, board certified psychiatrist, but by choice he works mainly with normal but excessively unhappy or unsuccessful people. Yet, because they are normal, i.e. possess brains that are free of significant malfunctions, Dr. Maultsby's patients and readers of his books want and are mentally capable of achieving as much personal success, plus emotional and spiritual satisfaction, for which they are willing to work. <p>Normal people's psychiatrists practice the Cognitive-Behavioral psychotherapy and counseling. Dr. Maultsby has had 30 plus years of clinical experience in professional training, research and clinical practice using this treatment method. He completed training in both child and adult psychiatry. He now is a Medical College Professor at Howard University and the author of the only comprehensive, short-term Cognitive-Behavioral psychotherapy and counseling method, called Rational Behavior Therapy, which produces long-term results. Rational Behavior Therapy, Dr. Maultsby's book by the same name, clearly demonstrates this now well established medical fact: "Much, if not most, anxiety and the other negative human emotions in normal people are unsuspectedly and therefore naively created by those entirely sane, intelligent people themselves". </p><p>His well know research and effective training and treatment methods have made Dr. Maultsby an internationally recognized expert on scientific, yet practical concepts and techniques of healthy human conflict resolution.

After working her way up as an intern, she burst on the scene as a young female jock whose on-air &#x201c;Battle of the Beats&#x201d; segment broke records and became a platform for emerging artists like a young Jay Z. Angie quickly became known for intimate, high-profile interviews, mediating feuds between artists, and taking on the most controversial issues in hip hop.

Beginning in England with George III's arrival in Weymouth in the early 1800s and his subsequent outing in a bathing machine, viewers follow along to the Prince Regent's (later George IV) building plans for that whimsical oriental fantasy, the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. In Victorian times, despite cumbersome garments, the well-to-do visitors actually venture onto the beach for donkey rides and wading. Edwardian times feature concerts and shows as seaside amusements, while prior to World War II, some enjoy tea dances at the "Grand Hotel," and others take in the arcades and fish-and-chip shops at popular resorts. World War II finds coastal artillery fortifying the shore lines, and all seaside holidays ceased. Today France and Spain, with their windsurfing and cheek-by-jowl beach towels, are the current destinations for contemporary seaside holiday makers. A one-page explanation of the scenes is included. It's a charming, evocative presentation and would have appeal to anglophiles, but will be of limited interest or relevance to average American children. --Phyllis G. Sidorsky, National Cathedral School, Washington, DC<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Once again Goodall ( The Story of a Farm ) exposes a rich slice of British society by examining a single scene in its various incarnations during several eras. Here, the seaside town of Weymouth plays host to activities both exotic and familiar. The curtain rises on a royal visit to the resort in the early 1800s; in subsequent spreads, we see adult pastimes such as shopping and tea dances, while children enjoy Punch and Judy shows, boating excursions and digging in the sand. With the advent of WW II, this holiday setting becomes a foreboding coastal defense area; and, on the book's final pages, backpackers, tall buildings and windsurfers testify to the inexorable march of progress. As in all of Goodall's similar works of social history, the central concept of the book is marvelously clean and simple, and is executed with meticulous attention to detail.

On its shores and islands they have built cities, colonised, dreamed, conquered and fallen. This sea, which brings together three continents, was the cradle of western civilisation. Ernle Bradford spent almost 30 years sailing into nearly every corner of the Mediterranean and here he tells its fascinating story. Once it was realised that the sea could be a link rather than a barrier, discovery was possible and he follows the explorations of the Egyptians, the Cretans, the Phoenicians, the Greeks and others. The Mediterranean became a Roman and Byzantine sea until displaced by the Arab and Turkish conquests which reached their apogee with the great siege of Malta in 1565; by the 18th century Europe again dominated, with France and England in contention for sovereignty. The author continues his story through the grand sweep of historic events including the Napoleonic wars, the building of the Suez Canal and on to two World Wars ending with the peace of 1945. Into his account of the history of the region, the author weaves a wealth of detail: of flora and fauna, trade and commerce, society and religion, war and peace. The result is a portrait of an enormously vibrant region and its people.</p><p></p><h2>Fatal Fairies (Renaissance Faire Mystery)</h2><p>When a fairy named Apple Blossom is found dead in a fountain, Ren Faire lover Jessie Morton makes a wish she lives to regret&#x2014;that her husband, Chase Manhattan, is no longer the Renaissance Faire Village Bailiff so he doesn&#x2019;t have to look for the fairy&#x2019;s killer and ruin their plans to go away for their first wedding anniversary.

No places or events are included, nor are personal names, except as the author of the books of the Bible, as in <i>Joel, Book of</i>. There are no entries for Adam, David, Jesus, or Moses.<p>On the other hand, there are hundreds of useful and well-illustrated entries, such as <i>alabaster</i>, <i>almond</i>, <i>altar</i>, <i>amulet</i>, <i>antelope</i>, <i>apron</i>, and <i>Aramaic</i>, to select but a few from the first part of the book. There are more than 1,500 such entries, with text running from about one-eighth to a whole page. All illustrations are in color, usually one or two to the page. Also in color are the occasional maps, tables of events, ancient measures (linear, liquid, etc.), and similar aids to understanding life in biblical times. Illustrations dominate spreads on special topics, such as Noah's Ark in the entry <i>Ark of the Covenant.</i></p><p><i>The text is accessible. Each entry contains a scriptural quotation at its beginning, taken from the New Revised Standard Version<i> </i>of the Bible (1989). At the end of the volume, besides an index, there is a glossary giving brief definitions of words not thought worth a full illustrated article in the main text. Typical glossary-only words include <i>birthday</i> and<i> berries</i>. It might have been a good idea to insert each of these into its proper place in the main text, with a <i>see </i>reference to the glossary. There are about 380 glossary-only definitions, and some are quite important, such as <i>breaking of bread </i>and <i>blood of the covenant</i>. Not all readers will locate the glossary, or remember to use it.</i></p><p><i>On the whole, this is a very good book for giving a basic understanding of biblical life and times, an explanation of the Jewish way of life, and definitions of everyday things and events in the daily lives of the People of the Book and their immediate neighbors. The illustrations are excellent, and the text is clear and easy to read. The work is recommended to all public libraries, synagogues, church and Sunday-school libraries, seminaries, and others where a clear, easy-to-read, and well-illustrated alternative to more scholarly and comprehensive works is desired. <i></i></i></p>The coverage in this lavishly illustrated dictionary on biblical times is succinct and easily absorbed by readers who need have little or no previous knowledge of the Bible. The result, however, is better suited for a coffee table than a library. The entries, which are not signed and cite no research literature, lack depth of treatment, and other features that make for a good library acquisition are missing, most significantly, a thorough and consistent system of cross references. For instance, the entry "Color" makes no reference to and has no references from the entries "Yellow," "Purple," "White," or "Crimson," though the volume's index does list cross references to "Dye," "Dyeing" and "Red" under "Color." Other general entries that lack significant cross references to and/or from related, but more specific, entries include those on "Animals," "Coin," "Holy Days," "Jewelry," "Measures," "Metal," "Musical Instruments," "Plants," "Spice," "Weapons," and "Writing" (for the latter of which there is often a significant illustration at the beginning of each new letter heading in the dictionary). The entry on "Breastpiece" has an insert illustration but needs also a reference to the artist's work relating to "Ephod," and vice versa. The entry under "Chariot" makes no reference to the illustration for it. There is also some indication of a want of more careful proofreading. For example, the illustration of the inscription on p. 33 is inverted, the name "Arad" is elsewhere twice spelled "Arat," and "Elijah" should replace "Eliza" on p. 222. Many artifacts are depicted without complete descriptions which should include date, material, and place of provenance for a reasonable interpretation thereof. Appropriate for home purchase but not well suited for public, academic, or theological libraries.?Robert H.

Its gold had fueled the economies of Europe and the Islamic world for nearly a millennium, and the sophisticated kingdoms spanning its west coast had traded with Europeans since the fifteenth century. Until at least 1650, this was a trade of equals, using a variety of currencies&#x2014;most importantly, cowrie shells imported from the Maldives and <i>nzimbu</i> shells imported from Brazil. But, as the slave trade grew, African kingdoms began to lose prominence in the growing global economy. We have been living with the effects of this shift ever since.&nbsp;<br><br> With <i>A Fistful of Shells,</i> Toby Green transforms our view of West and West-Central Africa by reconstructing the world of these kingdoms, which revolved around trade, diplomacy, complex religious beliefs, and the production of art. Green shows how the slave trade led to economic disparities that caused African kingdoms to lose relative political and economic power. The concentration of money in the hands of Atlantic elites in and outside these kingdoms brought about a revolutionary nineteenth century in Africa, parallel to the upheavals then taking place in Europe and America. Yet political fragmentation following the fall of African aristocracies produced radically different results as European colonization took hold.<br><br> Drawing not just on written histories, but on archival research in nine countries, art, oral history, archaeology, and letters, Green lays bare the transformations that have shaped world politics and the global economy since the fifteenth century and paints a new and masterful portrait of West Africa, past and present.</p><p><b>Toby Green</b> is a senior lecturer in Lusophone African history and culture at King&#x2019;s College London and&nbsp;is author of&nbsp;<i>The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300-1589</i>.&#x201c;Very seldom do I pick up a history book and wish I had written it myself. Toby Green&#x2019;s <i>Fistful of Shells</i> is one such book. Brilliantly conceptualized, beautifully written, <i>Fistful of Shells</i> breaks with colonially configured regional boundaries&#x2014;which work to re-create unintended silos of knowledge&#x2014;to imagine a West and West Central African Atlantic era history of money, power, religion, and inequality that is as rich as it is sound.&#x201d; (<i>Nwando Achebe, Jack and Margaret Sweet Endowed Professor of History, Michigan State University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The range and depth of this book is simply stunning. By masterfully drawing on primary research and secondary sources in multiple languages, Green delivers a provocative book that is also a landmark of historical imagination and craftsmanship.&#x201d; (<i>Roquinaldo Ferreira, Henry Charles Lea Professor of History, University of Pennsylvania</i>)<br><br>"A magisterial, extensive and fresh account of the history of West Africa that rewrites the region and its peoples back into World History, where they belong."&nbsp; (<i>Miranda Kaufmann, author of Black Tudors</i>)<br><br>"Toby Green's transformative book repositions West African history in an entirely new light.

Holbert's first victims were the Brown family, who lived on a remote island in the area's Darklands. There, Holbert turned their home into the "Jolly Roger Social Club," using drink- and drug-fueled parties to get to know other ex-pats. The club's tagline was: "Over 90% of our members survive." Those odds were not in his victims' favor.</p><p><i> The Jolly Roger Social Club</i> is not just a book about what Holbert did and the complex financial and real estate motives behind the killings; it is about why Bocas del Toro turned out to be his perfect hunting ground, and why the community tolerated-even accepted-him for a time. Told through the fascinating history of the country of Panama, a paradise with sinister ties to the political and economic interests of the United States, journalist Nick Foster brings this uniquely bizarre place to life; shedding light on a community where many live under assumed names, desperate to leave their old lives behind-and sometimes people just disappear.</p></p><p><b>Nick Foster</b> was born in Liverpool, UK in 1966, and educated at University College London.

He was, as his primary biographer Joseph Blumenthal observed, the ultimate "artificer of the book". His career as a working designer spanned six decades, but arguably his finest (and certainly his happiest) years were spent at Cambridge's Riverside Press where he took ovr from D.B. Updike in 1896 ad where he remained until 1912, overseeing his own department and designing at least sixty titles for Houghton Mifflin's list of Riverside Press Editions. <p> Boston was an interesting place at this time, the center of the Arts and Crafts movement, where Updike (never close to BR, whom he once called "an impossible person") had set up shop, and in which characters as diverse as Rudolph Ruzicka, W.A. Dwiggins, Bertram Goodhue, and Fred Holland Day circulated. George Mifflin was instrumental in starting the department for special editions under Rogers's supervision at Riverside and supported him against considerable opposition, stubbornly championing the legitimacy of publishing fine limited editions within the framework of a large commercial printer. In more than a decade, BR created some of his most successful designs, from the monumental three-volume folio Montaigne, with its specially cut type, to the delicate Virgil Georgiacs. Although the legacy of Pickering can be seen in many of his designs, as early as 1905 one can also detect the seductive influence of the French sixteenth century, and most especially of the masters Geofroy Tory, Jean de Tournes, Henri Estienne, and Nicolas Jenson.</p><p>This small and elegantly produced volume, aimed at the same audience who once appreciated (and who perhaps now collects) these paragons of the printer's art, contains an essay by Jerry Kelly outlining Rogers's tenure at Riverside, a checklist of all the work he executed there (for Houghton Mifflin as well as others), and twenty pages of reproductions displaying the full range of BR titles, specimens of printing that--as he later wistfully remarked-- "give me a definite satisfaction."</p></p><p></p><h2>Occult Science in India and Among the Ancients</h2><p>Though deeply sceptical with regard to spirits, I often wondered, whenever I saw an experiment of this kind, whether or not some natural force had not been brought into play, with which we were totally unacquainted.

The book asks: what if the Western secret services had succeeded in capturing Lenin as they planned? It reveals how the Western powers worked together first to persuade the Bolsheviks to stay in World War I, and then to attempt their overthrow during the Russian Civil War. It seems that the Bolsheviks often knew what their adversaries were doing and used them as dupes in their own plots.</p><p></p><h2>A Cold Creek Holiday (The Cowboys of Cold Creek, 7)</h2><p><br><br>All Emery Kendall wanted was to flee painful memories of Christmases past.

She loves to hear from readers and can be reached through her website at www.raeannethayne.com.<br><br>Few things gave a woman a sense of her own vulnerability like driving on an unfamiliar mountain road in the dark through a snowstorm.<br><br>Her knuckles white on the wheel of the small SUV she had rented at the Jackson Hole Airport, Emery Kendall squinted through the blowing flakes the wipers tried to beat away, desperate for any sign she was even on the right road.<br><br>The GPS unit on the rental wasn't working&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;and the directions she had printed off the Internet had already proved fallible twice.<br><br>She let out a breath. Stupid. This whole thing was a colossal mistake. What had seemed like such a logical plan in September, even a welcome excuse to escape the weight of her pain and grief and memories during the holidays, had lost a great deal of its allure the first time her tires slipped in the two or three inches of unplowed snow and the vehicle slid toward the ominous stretch of river ribboning beside the canyon road.<br><br>She had every reason to hate driving in the snow. It brought back too much pain, too many memories, and she couldn't help asking herself what on earth she was doing here. She should be safe at home in Virginia, snug in her townhouse with a fire crackling in the grate and a mug of hot cocoa at her elbow while she tried to wrap her recalcitrant head around her latest project.<br><br>Alone.<br><br>She clicked the wipers up to a faster rhythm as she approached a slight break in the dark silhouette of trees lining either side of the road.<br><br>A log arch over the side road was barely visible in her headlights, but she saw enough to make out the words burned into the wood.<br><br>Hope Springs Guest Ranch. Finally.<br><br>The owners really ought to think about a few well-placed landscaping lights so weary travelers knew they were in the right place.<br><br>Not that it was any of her business how they ran their guest ranch. Right now the only thing she cared about was reaching her rented cabin, hauling her things inside and collapsing on the bed for the next two or three days.<br><br>She turned into the driveway, which was unplowed with no tracks indicating anyone else had driven this way recently, at least not since the snow started to fall.<br><br>As the tires of the four-wheel-drive whirred through the virgin powder, that sense of vulnerability and unease returned, not so much from the weather now as the sobering realization that she was heading alone to a strange place&#x2014;and, she had to admit, from the knowledge that the Cold Creek Land &amp; Cattle Company was only a mile or so up the road.<br><br>The Daltons. Three men, brothers. Wade, Jake and Seth.<br><br>A tangle of conflicting emotions tumbled through her, but she quickly pushed them all away, as she had been doing since the September night when her mother's dying confession had rocked the entire foundation of her world.<br><br>Not now. All that could wait. At the moment, the more pressing need was to get out of this snow before she became hopelessly stranded and ended up freezing to death in a snow bank on the side of some obscure mountain road.<br><br>No Christmas lights illuminated the night, which she found odd for a guest ranch. Even a little string of white lights along the fenceline would have provided a much more cheery welcome than the unrelenting darkness.<br><br>Just when she was wondering if she had imagined that sign out front, she reached a cluster of buildings. A white-painted barn and a two-story log home dominated the scene and she was relieved to see the house ablaze with light.<br><br>The woman she had spoken with when she made the reservation months ago told her to check in at the main house. She had confirmed her reservation a few weeks ago and received the same instructions, though this time from a rather flighty sounding girl who had been somewhat vague, even as she assured Emery everything was in order for her arrival.<br><br>A cold wind dug under her jacket as she walked up the steps to the wide front porch, and she was grateful for her wool scarf and hat.<br><br>She rang the bell beside a carved wooden door and a few seconds later she heard from inside the thud of running feet and a decidedly young female voice. "Doorbell! Somebody's here! I'll get it, Uncle Nate."<br><br>Three heartbeats later, the door swung open and a dark-eyed girl of perhaps seven or eight peered out.<br><br>She didn't say anything, didn't even smile, just simply gazed out in her blue thermal pajamas, as if finding a bedraggled traveler on their doorstep in the middle of a stormy December night was a daily occurrence.<br><br>She supposed it likely was. They did run a guest ranch, after all.<br><br>Despite the girl's impassive expression, Emery forced a smile. "Hi. I'm Emery Kendall. I think I'm expected. I'm sorry I'm so late."<br><br>"It's okay. We're not in bed yet. Just a minute." She shifted her head and called over her shoulder. "Uncle Nate. It's a lady in a really pretty hat."<br><br>Emery touched her cloche, one of her own creations.<br><br>The girl held the door wide-open, but Emery didn't feel quite right about walking inside, invited only by an eight-year-old. Conversely, she also didn't feel right about standing in the open doorway, allowing all the delicious warmth from inside to wash past her and dissipate in the storm.<br><br>Before she could make up her mind, a man in a dark green wool henley, flannel shirt and Levi's walked into the entry.<br><br>He exuded danger, from his hard eyes to his unsmiling mouth to the solid, unyielding set to his jaw.<br><br>She had that unsettling cognizance of her own vulnerability again. Who knew she was coming to Idaho? Only Lulu, the manager of her store, and Freddie, her best friend.<br><br>Solitary Traveler Shows Up at Dark Mountain Lodge in a Storm, Never to Be Heard from Again. She could just see the headline now.<br><br>Or maybe she had spent too many sleepless nights in the past two years watching old Alfred Hitchcock movies on the classic film channel.<br><br>Just because the man <em>looked </em>dangerous didn't mean he necessarily was. How many serial killers sent little girls who called them Uncle Nate to greet their victims?<br><br>"Yes?" he asked, in a decidedly unwelcoming tone.<br><br>"I'm Emery Kendall."<br><br>He met her gaze with raised eyebrows and a blank look. "Sorry, is that supposed to mean something to me?"<br><br>If not for that sign out front, she would have worried she had the wrong place. Now she just wondered what wires had been crossed about her arrival date.<br><br>Either that, or this was the most inhospitable guest lodge it had ever been her misfortune to find.<br><br>"I have a reservation to stay in one of your cabins until the twenty-seventh of December," she said, fighting down that unease again. "I made the initial reservation several months ago and confirmed it only a few weeks ago with a woman named Joanie something or other. I have the paperwork if you'd like to confirm it."<br><br>"Joanie ran off." The pajama-clad girl had followed the man back into the room and she spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. "Uncle Nate is really mad."<br><br>"Uncle Nate" did indeed look upset. His mouth tightened even more and his eyes darkened to a hard black. She felt an unexpected pang of sympathy for the unknown woman. She wouldn't like to have all that leashed frustration aimed in <em>her </em>direction.<br><br>"Damn fool woman," he muttered.<br><br>For one crazy moment, she thought he meant her, then realized he must be referring to the absent Joanie.<br><br>"Is there a problem?" She couldn't help stating the obvious.<br><br>"You might say that." He raked a hand through short dark hair. "We run a pretty low-key operation here, Ms. Kendall. This isn't your average five-star hotel. We've only got a few guest cabins that are mostly empty in the winter."<br><br>"I understood that completely when I made the reservation. I saw the Web site and reviews and talked at length about the amenities with the woman who initially took my reservation. I'm perfectly fine with the arrangements."<br><br>She didn't add that they were ideal for her purposes, to be left alone for the holidays, away from the gaiety and the frenzy and the memories.<br><br>Not to mention the proximity of Hope Springs Guest Ranch to the Cold Creek ranch.<br><br>"Yeah, well, we've got one employee who usually handles everything from reservations to making the beds. Joanie Reynolds."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"And three days ago, she ran off with a cowboy she met at the Million Dollar Bar and I haven't seen her since. You want the truth, we're in a hell of a mess."<br><br>He didn't look apologetic in the slightest, only frustrated, as if the whole mess were <em>Emery's </em>fault.<br><br>She was exhausted suddenly from the long day of traveling, from flight delays and long security lines and two hours of driving on unfamiliar roads. All she wanted was to sink into a bed somewhere and sleep until she could think straight once more.<br><br>"What do you suggest I do, then? I had a reservation. I made a deposit and everything. And I've been traveling for eight hours."<br><br>She heard the slightly forlorn note in her voice and wanted to wince. Nate Whoever-He-Was must have heard it, too. A trace of regret flickered in the depths of those dangerous dark eyes.<br><br>He sighed heavily. "Come in out of the cold. We'll figure something out."<br><br>She hesitated for just a moment, that serial-killer scenario flitting through her head again, but she pushed it away. Little girl, remember?<br><br>Inside the house, she was immediately struck by the vague sense of neglect. The furnishings were warm and comfortable, an appealing mix of antique, reproduction and folk art pieces. Through the doorway, she glimpsed a great room with soaring vaulted ceilings. A lovely old schoolhouse quilt had prominence against the wall and she fought the urge to whip out her sketchbook and pencils to get those particular umber and moss tones down on paper.<br><br>But she also didn't miss the cobwebs in the corner of the space and a messy pile of mail and unread newspapers scattered across the top of the console table in the entryway where she stood.<br><br>Nor did she miss the wide, muscled shoulders of the man, or the way they tapered to slim hips.<br><br>"Is there anywhere else close by I could stay?" she asked, more than a little aghast at her inconvenient and unexpected reaction to him.<br><br>He turned with a frown and she sincerely hoped he couldn't see that little niggle of attraction.<br><br>"Not really, I'm sorry to say," he answered. "There are a couple other guest ranches in the area, but everybody else closes down for the winter. There's a motel in town, but I couldn't recommend it."<br><br>"Why do you stay open when everybody else shuts down?"<br><br>He made a face as if the very question had occurred to him more than once. "We have some hardcore snowmo-bilers who've been staying since the ranch opened to guests five years ago. Their bookings are being honored, though we haven't taken new ones since...well, probably since you made your reservations."<br><br>A muscle flexed in his jaw. "Look, do you mind waiting here while I check the computer?"<br><br>"I have a copy of my reservation in the rental. I can get it for you."<br><br>"I believe you. I just want to figure out what Joanie has done. For all I know, we're hosting a damn convention she forgot to mention to me before she ran off. Just give me five minutes."<br><br>He walked away, leaving her standing in the entryway with the little girl&#x2014;who was suddenly joined by another girl who looked perhaps a few years older. Her hair wasn't quite as long and her features were thinner. But just like her sister&#x2014;they looked so much alike, they could be nothing else&#x2014;she said nothing, just regarded Emery with solemn, dark eyes.<br><br>Something strange was going on at the Hope Springs Ranch. She couldn't help noticing a large artificial Christmas tree in the great room, but it was bare of lights or ornaments, and as far as she could tell, that was the only concession to the holidays within her view.<br><br>"I really like your hat," the younger girl who had answered the door finally said to break the silence.<br><br>She smiled at her, despite her exhaustion. "Thank you. I made it."<br><br>"You made it?" The older girl's eyes widened. "Like you sewed it and stuff?"<br><br>"Yes. And I designed the material."<br><br>The girl frowned, clearly skeptical. "Nobody designs material. You just buy it at the sewing store. That's what our mom used to do anyway."<br><br>"Before she died," the younger one added.<br><br>"Be quiet, Tallie," her sister snapped. "She doesn't need to know <em>everything."</em><br><br>Emery wanted to tell them she might not know everything, but she did know about losing a mother. Her own had only been gone a few months. But she supposed the experience of a twenty-seven-year-old woman losing her mother was quite different than that of two young girls.<br><br>"You do pick out material in a fabric store," she answered. "But someone has to design the material in the first place and decide what color dyes and what sort of fibers to use. That's what I do."<br><br>She didn't add that her fledgling textile line had recently been called "innovative, exciting and warmly elegant" by the leading trade magazine.<br><br>"Can you show me how to make a hat like that?"<br><br>"Me, too!" The younger girl exclaimed. "If Claire gets to make one, I want to. I can give it to my friend Frances for Christmas."<br><br>"Ooh, maybe I could make two," her sister said. "One for Natalie and one for Morgan. They're my very best friends."<br><br>"Can I make a pink one?" Tallie asked. "I <em>love </em>pink, and so does Frances."<br><br>"Ooh, I would like purple," her sister said. "Or maybe red."<br><br>Emery shifted, wondering where in Hades their uncle had disappeared to and how the situation had suddenly spiraled out of her control. It must be the fatigue&#x2014;or perhaps her complete lack of experience with young girls.<br><br>"I don't even know if I'm staying here yet. Your uncle and I are still working out the details."<br><br>The expression on both faces shifted from excitement to resignation in a blink and she wondered what in their young lives had contributed to their cynicism.<br><br>She hated sounding like such a grump, especially toward two girls who had lost their mother. "If I'm staying, we can see," she amended.<br><br>That was apparently enough for them. For the next few moments the girls talked about colors and patterns until their uncle returned to the room.<br><br>"Your reservation wasn't on the main calendar in the office, but I found it on a deleted copy of her files from the hard drive backup. I don't know what happened. Everything is in such a mess."<br><br></p><h2>In a Patch of Fireweed: A Biologist&#39;s Life in the Field</h2><p>One of the world&#39;s foremost physiological ecologists discusses his life and work as a scientist and recounts in detail years spent in research in the wild in many parts of the world</p><p>Part autobiography, part case study in the ways of field biology, &#39;In a Patch of Fireweed&#39; is an endlessly fascinating account of a scientist&#39;s life and work.

Here for the first time is a young Filipino girl&#x2019;s view of life in Hawaii and central California in the first decades of the twentieth century&#x2015;a significant and often turbulent period for immigrant and migrant labor in both settings. Angeles&#x2019; vivid, simple language takes us into the heart of an early Filipino family as its members come to terms with poverty and racism and struggle to build new lives in a new world. But even as Angeles recounts the hardships of immigrant life, her diary of "everyday things" never lets us forget that she and the people around her went to school and church, enjoyed music and dancing, told jokes, went to the movies, and fell in love. <br><br>Essays by Jonathan Okamura and Dawn Mabalon enlarge on Angeles&#x2019; account of early working-class Filipinos and situate her experience in the larger history of Filipino migration to the United States.</p></p><p>Rizaline R.

Her character primarily works as a device, reintroducing readers to the disparate members of the Lebeuf family. Lester, no longer donning his toy superhero cape, is a little more grown up but seems lonely, while Jimmy continues to hide himself in his job at the town filling station. Anne decides to help the family heal by urging Jimmy to step forward and finally get to know his young son Lester, giving more formal answers to questions of lineage and familial tragedy that were only hinted at in the earlier books. Lemire's cartoonlike art is more cinematic than ever here, making full poetic use of wintry Canadian landscapes to force readers to pause and feel the emotions of the characters. A side story features Lawrence, a Lebeuf ancestor who grew up in a desolate orphanage managed by a nun and a gruff caretaker. Although these flashbacks don't have a direct impact on the modern-day Lebeufs, the past events do bring a deeper layer of history to the family. The first two volumes worked exceptionally well as stand-alone stories. While Lemire still creates memorable moments in this finale, readers will want to know what happened in the previous tales to appreciate this one fully. Well written and beautifully drawn, this wonderful close to a powerful trilogy is ideal for fans of realistic stories in comics.&#x2014;<i>Matthew L.

First published in 1926, this timeless tale of the Cotton Blossom, Cap&#x2019;n Andy, his shrewd wife Parthy, and their beautiful daughter Magnolia her remarkable daughter Kim was made famous on Broadway in 1927, when the legendary Jerome S. Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II collaborated on the musical. Since then it has become a beloved favorite, revived repeatedly to entertain generations with haunting and lyrical songs such as &#x201c;Old Man River&#x201d; and &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t Help Lovin&#x2019; That Man of Mine.&#x201d;</p><p>In addition to SHOW BOAT, <b>Edna Ferber</b> (1885-1968) wrote the very successful <i>Dinner at Eight </i>and <i>Stage Door</i>, both collaborations with George S. Kaufman. A member of the Algonquin Round Table, she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1925 for her work <i>So Big</i>.<i>Excerpted from the Foreword by Foster Hirsch</i><br><b>FOREWORD</b><br>As all connoisseurs of the American musical theater readily acknowledge, Florenz Ziegfeld&#x2019;s 1927&nbsp; production of Show Boat, with a score by Jerome Kern and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, is America&#x2019;s first serious musical play&#x2014;a landmark. The show&#x2019;s startling opening lines&#x2014;&#x201c;Niggers all work on de Mississippi, / Niggers all work while de white folks play&#x201d;&#x2014;issued an immediate challenge. Also revolutionary was the level of integration between music and narrative; in unprecedented ways, most of the songs and dances grew out of and complemented the action. Kern&#x2019;s soaring score and Hammerstein&#x2019;s big-hearted lyrics for &#x201c;Ol&#x2019; Man River,&#x201d; &#x201c;You Are Love,&#x201d; &#x201c;Make Believe,&#x201d; &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t Help Lovin&#x2019; Dat Man,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Bill&#x201d; (original lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse and revised by Hammerstein) have ensured the work&#x2019;s enduring appeal. MGM&#x2019;s 1951&nbsp; fi lm carried the following description: &#x201c;based upon the Immortal Musical Play.&#x201d;<br><br>Often overlooked is that Kern and Hammerstein had adapted the 1926&nbsp; bestselling novel by Edna Ferber, which provided all the characters, the settings, the plot points, and&#x2014;not least&#x2014;the song cues. Ferber&#x2019;s description of the arrival of the show boat, for example, cries out for musical accompaniment: &#x201c;As they neared the landing, the band, perched atop the , forward, alternated with&nbsp; the calliope. From the town, hurrying down the streets, through the woods, dotting the levee and the landing, came eager figures, black and white.&#x201d; Wisely, Kern and Hammerstein seized on the scene as the inspiration for their show&#x2019;s high-stepping opening numbers, &#x201c;Cotton Blossom&#x201d; and &#x201c;Cap&#x2019;n Andy&#x2019;s Ballyhoo.&#x201d; <br><br>With its picturesque backdrop, its sweeping-across-the-generations narrative, and its richly evoked Americana, <i>Show Boat</i> is camera-ready, grist for the Broadway and Hollywood mills. But the novel is far more than a template for big-budget theatrical adaptations; it is a work of genuine literary craftsmanship. Ferber had a knack for selecting unusual settings steeped in American history. During a troubled out-of-town tryout for her play Minick&nbsp; (cowritten with George S. Kaufman), theatrical producer Winthrop Ames told Ferber about show boats; she knew at once he had given her the seed for the kind of robust saga of the American past that was already her specialty. Like a vigilant graduate student Ferber embarked on a program of intensive research, supplementing her extensive reading with firsthand experience on an actual show boat, the James Adams Floating Theatre, hosted by producer Charles Hunter and his actress wife, Beulah Adams, who was known as the &#x201c;Mary Pickford of the Chesapeake.&#x201d;<br><br>Though Ferber had never been on the Mississippi before she wrote the novel, the river becomes her central character, a commanding, mystical presence that guides the denizens of the show boat to their awaiting destinies. In her vivid opening chapter, &#x201c;the roar and howl and crash of the great river&#x201d; envelop the action.<br><br>Throughout, Ferber paints radiant wide-screen vistas:<br><br><i>When April came, and the dogwood flashed its spectral<br>white in the woods, the show boat started. It was<br>the most leisurely and dreamlike of journeys. . . .<br>Miles&#x2014;hundreds&#x2014;thousands of miles of willow-fringed<br>streams fl owing aquamarine in the sunlight,<br>olive-green in the shade.</i><br><br>Equally lyrical are the stage-struck novelist&#x2019;s accounts of the shows performed on the show boat&#x2014;the hoary melodramas and the minstrelsy-based olios. &#x201c;To the farmers and villagers of the Midwest; and to the small planters&#x2014;black and white&#x2014;of the South, the show boat meant music, romance, gaiety,&#x201d; she writes with the fervor of a die-hard theater lover.<br><br><i>It penetrated settlements whose backwoods dwellers<br>had never witnessed a theatrical performance in all<br>their lives&#x2014;simple childlike credulous people to whom<br>the make-believe villainies, heroics, loves, adventures<br>of the drama were so real as to cause the Cotton Blossom<br>troupe actual embarrassment.</i><br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Often quality folk came to the show boat,&#x201d; Ferber adds, and her racing syntax makes it easy to imagine the author herself waiting on the levee in anticipation of showtime.<br><br>Ferber&#x2019;s strength is in her panoramic long shots. Breadth, scope, horizontality are the cinematic qualities that link her work to the swashbuckling style of Hollywood epics. Her detractors claim that in close-ups&#x2014;in her characterizations and her intimate scenes&#x2014;she lacks depth.<br><br>This may be true enough, often enough to have blocked Ferber from admission to the literary pantheon: her characters can seem drawn to type, lacking dimension and complexity. But in her strongest writing&#x2014;in <i>Show Boat</i>, <i>Cimarron</i>, and <i>Giant</i> &#x2014;she outwits her critics and creates characters of size. In <i>Show Boat</i> her three principal female characters&#x2014;her high-strung, questing heroine Magnolia; Magnolia&#x2019;s forbidding mother, Parthy; and Magnolia&#x2019;s nurturing friend, Julie, a mulatto&#x2014;are more sharply drawn than in Hammerstein&#x2019;s libretto. Because at heart Edna herself was beyond the reach of piety or sentimentality, she holds her characters to a stricter reckoning than Hammerstein, blessed with a sunnier disposition and angling for a Broadway hit, was able to.<br><br>&nbsp;Ferber&#x2019;s Magnolia, far more than Irene Dunne&#x2019;s prim interpretation in the 1936&nbsp; fi lm or Kathryn Grayson&#x2019;s sugar-coated heroine in the 1951&nbsp; version, is defiant, a backwoods rebel who identifies with the turbulent Mississippi rather than its placid tributaries. Repeatedly, Magnolia stands up to her tyrannical, frostbitten mother. Against her mother&#x2019;s orders, she marries an untrustworthy buccaneer, riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal; when he abandons her and their daughter, Kim, she has the strength to survive on her own, first as an entertainer and then as the proprietress of the Cotton Blossom . &#x201c;There stood Magnolia Ravenal on the upper deck of the Cotton Blossom Floating Palace Theatre, silhouetted against sunset sky and water&#x2014;tall, erect, indomitable,&#x201d; Ferber writes about her heroine in the book&#x2019;s final scene. Surviving without a man by her side, the fearsomely independent Magnolia has become a proto-feminist, and as enduring as the river.<br><br>It&#x2019;s tempting to see the strong-willed Magnolia as a projection of the novelist herself, a lifelong spinster &#x201c;married&#x201d; to her work, a woman without a man, who husbanded her zest for life, her great curiosity, and her equally great ambition, into her writing. Ferber slyly places her endorsement of Magnolia against her disapproval of Magnolia&#x2019;s convent-educated daughter, Kim, who has an orderly marriage and a career as &#x201c;almost the first of this new crop of intelligent, successful, deft, workmanlike, intuitive, vigorous, adaptable young women of the theater. There was about her&#x2014;about them&#x2014;nothing of genius, of greatness, of the divine fire.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ferber&#x2019;s Parthy is a darker&#x2014;fiercer&#x2014;character than Hammerstein&#x2019;s sentimental libretto could sustain. Like the Mississippi, she is omnipresent and implacable. And perhaps reflecting Ferber&#x2019;s tortured relationship with her own unyielding mother, she is unlovable. Typically, however, as in both the 1936&nbsp; and 1951 films, Parthy is played as a comic character&#x2014;a domestic scold. But Ferber has higher intentions: &#x201c;There stood Parthenia Ann Hawks . . . a massive and almost menacing figure in her robes of black&#x2014;tall, erect, indomitable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indomitable&#x201d; women; weak or irresponsible men: this is a recurrent pattern in Ferber&#x2019;s work, nowhere more central to her theme than in the matriarchal <i>Show Boat</i>. It is after they lose their mates&#x2014;Cap&#x2019;n Andy drowns; Gaylord Ravenal disappears&#x2014;that the women thrive: Parthy assumes command of the Cotton Blossom; Magnolia awakens. The men are not of the same caliber. Cap&#x2019;n Andy is genial, softhearted, generous of spirit&#x2014;but he can&#x2019;t survive the raging river. Ravenal is handsome, passionate, sometimes caring&#x2014;but ultimately a cad. Ferber introduces the gambler with a cunning detail: seen from a distance, standing on the levee, he looks like a dashing gentleman; up close, his shoes are cracked and his clothes too shiny.<br><br>Ferber works hard to give shading to her tarnished &#x201c;hero,&#x201d; but he remains a stock figure out of a romance novel. Is there a streak of male-hating, or at least of resentment of the sexual male animal, in Ferber&#x2019;s dipped-in-acid portrait? &#x201c;He was not an especially intelligent man,&#x201d; she writes about Ravenal. &#x201c;He had no need to be.&#x201d; Ferber&#x2019;s characterization is also undermined by her curious avoidance of sex. There are no scenes of love-making between her spirited heroine and the presumably hot-blooded gambler&#x2014;the author&#x2019;s descriptions of the surging river have more sexual force than her tepid accounts of Magnolia&#x2019;s marriage.<br><br>In the musical, both Cap&#x2019;n Andy and Ravenal survive. Unharmed by the river, Hammerstein&#x2019;s captain remains first to last the show&#x2019;s jaunty master of ceremonies, and along with Parthy, Magnolia, and Kim, he is onstage at the end, alive and kicking, as three generations of Hawkses celebrate life on the river. Whereas Ferber dismisses Ravenal in a cryptic sentence (&#x201c;Magnolia never saw him again&#x201d;), in Hammerstein&#x2019;s libretto, as if rising from the dead, he returns to the show boat for a tear-jerking reconciliation. Ferber&#x2019;s finale, a woman alone, triumphant in her solitude, is of course much harsher than Hammerstein&#x2019;s bow to domesticity and inclusiveness&#x2014;and decidedly more modern. <br><br>Perhaps because it defies the logic of Ferber&#x2019;s original design, all&nbsp; attempts by Hammerstein and other adapters to reinsert Ravenal have been trivializing. The worst &#x201c;solution&#x201d; is Hammerstein&#x2019;s for the 1936&nbsp; fi lm: by outrageous coincidence Ravenal is the doorman at the theater where Kim is having a rip-roaring opening night, as Magnolia, a retired star, watches the show from a private box seat. The smartest is screenwriter John Lee Mahin&#x2019;s invention for the 1951&nbsp; film: meeting by chance on a riverboat, Julie tells Ravenal that he has a daughter, of whom he was not aware, thereby motivating his return to the Cotton Blossom.<br><br>&nbsp;While it reflects the racial politics of a bygone age, Ferber&#x2019;s depiction of the light-skinned Julie, who passes for white, is unflinching. When the fact of her Negro heritage is revealed, Julie and her common-law husband, Steve, must leave the show boat, a departure that exposes the racism in the southern culture of the era. Ferber attempts what none of her adapters has ever tried for: she suggests that the rebellious outsider Magnolia is metaphorically a &#x201c;black&#x201d; character. In the novel&#x2019;s most moving scene, when Magnolia embraces Julie as she is about to depart forever from the show boat, the two characters seem to merge.<br><br><i>And when finally they came together, the woman<br>dropped on her knees in the dust of the road and gathered<br>the weeping child to her and held her close, so that<br>as you saw them sharply outlined against the sunset the<br>black of the woman&#x2019;s dress and the white of the child&#x2019;s<br>frock were as one.</i><br><br>&nbsp;Striking out on her own, Magnolia becomes an acclaimed singer of &#x201c;coon songs,&#x201d; which she had learned from Negro workers on the Cotton Blossom.&nbsp; &#x201c;You a nigger?&#x201d; snaps the bigoted owner of a club in Chicago for whom Magnolia auditions. &#x201c;You cer&#x2019;nly sing like one.&#x201d; A highlight of the 1936&nbsp; fi lm is when Irene Dunne, performing &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t Help Lovin&#x2019; Dat Man,&#x201d; breaks into a Negro shuffle, becoming &#x201c;black&#x201d; before our eyes as she imitates the movements she has&nbsp; learned from her Negro friends, who sing along with her. (The 1951 version destroys the point of the song by turning it into a duet between Magnolia and Julie and segregating the Negro characters on a lower level of the show boat.) In the novel, as in all versions of <i>Show Boat</i>&nbsp; except the 1951&nbsp; fi lm, Julie returns only once after she leaves the Cotton Blossom . Ferber&#x2019;s scene is stark. When Magnolia goes to the house of a notorious Chicago madam to return one thousand dollars that Ravenal has borrowed, Julie appears as the madam&#x2019;s gaunt accountant. &#x201c;A white face&#x2014;no, not white&#x2014;ivory, like something dead. . . . The eyes were incredibly black in that ivory face.&#x201d; When she recognizes Magnolia, Julie flees in horror. The encounter couldn&#x2019;t furnish Kern and Hammerstein with the song cue they needed, so, understandably, they place Julie at a night club where she performs &#x201c;Bill,&#x201d; a torch song about a man who got away. (Helen Morgan&#x2019;s world-weary performance of the song in the 1936&nbsp; fi lm is indelible. In the 1951&nbsp; fi lm, Ava Gardner&#x2019;s rendition, dubbed by Annette Warren, inaptly evokes Hollywood glamour.)<br><br>For a rousing Broadway revival in 1994 , Hal Prince, with the permission of the Rodgers and Hammerstein office, extensively revised the show&#x2019;s ragged second act; his version is now the official one. Until that point, <i>Show Boat</i>&nbsp; had never had a published script and so had never been &#x201c;frozen.&#x201d; From the initial production in 1927&nbsp; until Prince&#x2019;s staging nearly seventy years later, <i>Show Boat</i>&nbsp; was subjected to numerous revisions, with numbers, characters, and scenes added, dropped, repositioned.<br><br>For good reason, the show has been assailed for its structural flaws, and though Ferber herself has often been blamed, in fact her novel is more sturdily built than any of the movable-feast adaptations. The weakest moment in the play and the films is a scene that doesn&#x2019;t appear in the novel, a chance encounter in a Chicago rooming house between two Cotton Blossom&nbsp; troupers and Magnolia that motivates the rest of the action. The coincidental meeting is as contrived as any in the blood-and-thunder melodramas performed on the show boat.<br><br>Nonetheless, there is a fl aw in Ferber&#x2019;s narrative design that no adaptation can ever overcome. Once the setting shifts from the river to Chicago, where Ravenal becomes a full-time gambler, there is a distinct letdown. Ferber works with her customary zeal to enliven the gambling world of Chicago, but the setting can&#x2019;t match her rapturous accounts of life on the river. And in her final section, set on Broadway in the 1920 s, a world she knew firsthand, her scene-setting is oddly stingy.<br><br>But at her best, when she&#x2019;s on the show boat as it makes its way down the river, Ferber writes with a bardic, incantatory impact. As she lunges with almost biblical intensity into descriptive passages replete with repetition and elaborate parallel constructions, and as she piles on adjective after adjective, her writing is occasionally tinted with purple. But who would want to stop her? In the most musical sections of <i>Show Boat</i> , as her prose hums along with a rapt rhythm, Ferber proves beyond any doubt that she is a popular writer of scintillating gifts. It is an honor to welcome her resplendent pageant back into print.<br><br><i><br>Foster Hirsch, professor of film at Brooklyn College, is the author of sixteen books on film and theater, including <b>Kurt Weill on Stage and Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King</b>.

She lives in Toronto.<b>A MICROHISTORY OF PAIN<br><br></b><i>I have given a name to my pain, and call it "dog."<br></i>Friedrich Nietzsche, <i>The Gay Science<br><br></i>Pain is the Sasquatch of science, never witnessed, only endlessly speculated on. We can't even agree on the species. Man or beast? A sensation or an idea? It doesn't help that ideas about the meanings of pain are double-barreled abstractions that soon drift away from the experience itself into an epistemological fog.<br><br>Our efforts to describe pain soon confront us with another small problem: How do we define the self? What particular nexus of mind, body, and soul is this modern "I" who feels the strange brew of modern pain?<br><br>I've been ruthlessly selective in this chapter, skipping over many names and en-tire centuries, to avoid disappearing down philosophical cul-de-sacs. But as I began to investigate the earliest ideas of pain, what struck me was that philosophy, medicine, and drama were once much closer in the way they viewed pain. It wasn't until Descartes came along in the seventeenth century with "proof" of the mind-body split, followed by the age of Enlightenment, that pain began to shed its emotional and social dimensions. One of the earliest definitions of tragedy, for instance, was human pain-as our exile into something that can be witnessed and pitied, but never shared.<br><br>Philoctetes, a play written by Sophocles in 409 b.c., is a story that pivots around the physical pain of its main character, who suffers from a wound that began as a snake bite. "Terrible it is, beyond words' reach" is how Philoctetes describes his condition. This inviolate, unspeakable aspect of human pain is what the drama tries to voice. "Philoctetes makes us feel the power of pain to reduce a life to utter emptiness and misery," author David Morris writes in The Culture of Pain. "It unweaves the self until the self is nothing but pain. The body in tragedy is not just something we possess like an identifying birthmark or robe or kingdom," Morris argues, "but what we are. It both deWnes us, and, fatally, limits us."<br><br>Aristotle was another astute observer of human dramas, including pain, and his writings on the subject turn out to have a rather modern flair. He defined pain as an emotion rather than a mechanical sensation. He characterized both pain and pleasure as "appetites" that drive us toward the objects of our desires and away from the things that hurt us. For Aristotle, pain was not only a sensory event in the body, but a subjective state, like longing and fear. He saw the human cost of pain, how it "upsets and destroys the nature of the person who feels it." Aristotle may not have understood physiology, but he accepted the idea that pain is an expression of who we are.<br><br>Our uncertainty about the province of pain is conveyed by the roots of the words we use for it. Pain is probably derived from the Latin word <i>poena</i>, meaning punishment, and the English word tends to connote physical pain. But the French word <i>douleur</i>, from the Latin dolor, refers to both physical and mental pain. The French word <i>peine</i> suggests punishment, but it can mean sorrow as well. Oddly enough, the Italian language has no word for ache, despite the fact that studies of pain expression in different cultures report that Italian women in labor are louder than women from other countries.<br><br>The concept of pain as punishment turns up most vividly in the biblical story of Job, a wealthy, upright man whose faith in God is tested by Satan in a series of terrible afflictions. First he loses his wealth, then he becomes an outcast from his community. Finally Satan pulls out all the stops and inflicts a "plague of boils" on Job. "He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare," says Job, describing Satan's work. "He pours out my gall on the ground." William Blake's illustration of this scene shows the figure of Job writhing on the ground, his hands arched back in pain, as a naked, burly Satan stands over him like a TV wrestler in triumph. Job's test of faith is the first example of the theme of bloody martyrdom that runs throughout Christianity. Pain is inseparable from faith and "the central Christian mystery of a being who suffers pain in order to redeem others," as Morris writes. It was the pain that Jesus Christ suffered on the cross that proved to us that God's son was human, too. Suffering pain is how faith is forged; transcending pain is a mark of sainthood. The image of St. Sebastian pierced with arrows, with upturned eyes, carries the message that a belief in a life beyond the body has the power to undo pain. The idea of pain as spiritual punishment is still deeply entrenched in our attitude that physical pain arrives as a kind of moral test of character and should be toughed out. The price of admission for being human, the story of Job reminds us, is this: expect boils.<br><br>Fast-forward to the Middle Ages, a time when it was hell to have a toothache, even though laudanum laced with opium was readily dispensed. One of the opiophiles of the era was the enlightened sixteenth-century practitioner Paracelsus. He was the original patient-centered physician. "Every physician must be rich in knowledge," he wrote in Man and His Body, "and not only of that which is written in books; his patients should be his book, they will never mislead him . . . and by them he will never be deceived. But he who is content with mere letters is like a dead man; and he is like a dead physician." We may be overdue for a Paracelsus revival.<br><br>The man most responsible for our modern misconception of "mental pain" versus "physical pain," however, was the seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist Rene Descartes. Although he is often blamed for the mind-body split that came to characterize Western thinking, in other ways, Descartes's investigation into pain was farsighted. In the treatise De l'homme, his hypothesis about pain pathways and the "delicate threads" that conduct pain signals, for instance, turned out to be a crude but correct notion of nerve fibers and neurotransmitters. But it was his theory of the transmission of pain signals that led to what is known as the "specificity theory" of pain-the notion of pain as one fixed pathway or center. This idea dominated the study of pain until the last thirty or forty years.<br><br>Descartes's theory was accompanied by a famous illustration of a rather hunchbacked naked man, eyes a-bulge, who appears to be stepping into a campfire. His foot is in the flame. "If for example fire comes near the foot," he wrote in 1640, "minute particles of this fire, which you know move at great velocity, have the power to set in motion the spot of skin on the foot which they touch, and by this means pulling on the delicate thread which is attached to the spot of the skin, they open up at the same instant the pore against which the delicate thread ends, just as by pulling on one end of a rope one makes to strike at the same instant a bell which hangs at the end."<br><br>Descartes has helpfully labeled the diagram. The sensation of pain (A) is perceived in the foot and then travels up to the "common sense center" (F) in the pineal gland, which interprets the signal as pain. This same stimulus-response model still defines our popular understanding of pain: The coffee table hits your toe, a sensation in the nerves then tugs at the bell-rope of the brain, which interprets this event as pain. No coffee table, no pain. But even in his time, Descartes had to defend this theory against critics. When it was pointed out to him that some amputees still feel pain in their missing limbs-phantom limb pain-he nimbly responded that the brain was just being tricked by false signals. But he still characterized the mind as a passive central switchboard instead of as a coauthor of pain.<br><br>In Descartes's mechanistic view, pain is something that happens to the body, a sensation then promoted to the status of a concept in the brain. A worker-CEO arrangement, you could say, except that the goods flow only one way. Although the brain is the boss, it is a passive decoder, and pain only runs along one track, with its own special apparatus, impervious to emotions or environmental factors.<br><br>The race for pain's Northwest Passage-the path it takes in the body-was under way, and for the next three hundred years science pursued this mysterious trail. Pain began to lose its multiple meanings, as a visionary experience in religion, or as an expressive element of tragedy. Instead, pain became the property of science and medicine, even though they didn't quite know what to make of it. The focus shifted from exploring the questions of identity, consciousness, and grace that pain raises to describing its mechanisms in the body and brain. The pharmaceutical age began at the end of the nineteenth century. Cutting pain out of the body, cutting nerves, and killing pain became the new goals.<br><br>A time line of some of the landmarks of pain science and treatment over the past two centuries might look like this:<br><br>1803Morphine is synthesized from opium<br><br>1846The discovery of anesthesia<br><br>1853The invention of the hypodermic needle<br><br>1853Acetylsalicylic acid, predecessor to aspirin is developed<br><br>1914The Harrison Act in the United States sets restrictions on narcotic drugs<br><br>1943Pain Mechanisms published by William Livingston<br><br>1946Henry Beecher's work on the power of the placebo<br><br>1965The gate-control theory of pain published by Melzack and Wall in the journal Science<br><br>1966The first hospice, St. Christopher's, opens in the United Kingdom<br><br>1973International Association for the Study of Pain holds its first congress<br><br>1975The McGill Pain Questionnaire (first measurement of pain intensity)<br><br>1976Discovery of endorphins<br><br>1986The World Health Organization publishes The Analgesic Ladder: Guidelines to Cancer Pain Relief<br><br>2000The U.S...</p><h2>Big Book of Juices and Smoothies: 365 Natural Blends for Health and Vitality Every Day (The Big Book Of...series)</h2><p>Juice bars are all the rage, but making the drinks at home is an easy and less expensive way to sustain a smoothie habit. <i>The Big Book of Juices and Smoothies</i> features 365 healthy, delicious recipes, many of which can be prepared with nothing more than a blender.

Well constructed incidents, including the widowed mother giving up her children so they can be sent west to find a better life, a grass fire set by sparks from the train, and a holdup of the train contribute to fast action and considerable suspenseparticularly about the oldest girl, Frances, who disguises herself as a boy so she can better help her brothers and sisters. An Orphan for Nebraska (Atheneum, 1979) by Charlene Joy Talbot is a similar orphan train story, but about one boy. Patricia Beatty's That's One Ornery Orphan (Morrow, 1980) is more humorous but less of a saga. What happened to orphans and street children of the last century may well appeal to many of today's children who hear so much about street children and abducted and deserted kids.

He lives in California.Ellison's first book in six years, a harvesting of previously uncollected stories, is one of his best. The 17 stories are prefaced by "The Wind Took Your Answer Away," a remembrance and homage to the author's friends who have died since 1985and there have been manywritten with sadness and rage. Indeed, death or mourning figure in many of these tales. "Paladin of the Lost Hour" is an overly sentimental tale of an old man who keeps guard over an exiled hour that must never enter the time stream, lest time itself come to an end, and how he passes on his stewardship. Funny and intriguing, "Laugh Track" features a magician of a sound editor who conjures up the soul of the long-dead favorite aunt of a Hollywood writer from the sound of her laughter on an ancient sitcom laugh track. "Prince Mishkin, and Hold the Relish" is an hilarious anecdotal short-short about messed-up relationships between men and women and Dostoyevski. The urban horror story "Soft Monkey" tells of a retarded homeless old woman who witnesses a murder and is in turn pursued by the killers. Ellison's stories have too often been mechanistic, thin ideas fleshed out in overwriting and sentimentality. In this collection he demonstrates he's moving beyond that, becoming more complex, relaxed and reaching for emotion rather than sentiment. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Exploring the Inside Passage to Alaska: A Cruising Guide from the San Juan Islands to Glacier Bay</h2><p>Item is in like new condition with minimal signs of wear.</p><p></p><h2>City And Soul: Uniform (James Hillman Uniform Edition)</h2><p>Forty-two chapters comprise Hillman&#x2019;s writings on the psychology of public affairs: urbanism, environmental aesthetics, citizenship, and politics.</p><p>The pioneering imaginative psychology of James Hillman that soon will span five decades has entered cultural history, affecting lives and minds in a wide range of fields.

Robyn and her husband live in Las Vegas, Nevada. You can visit Robyn Carr&#x2019;s website at www.RobynCarr.com.</p>June stood in the shower a little longer than usual, preoccupied with a conversation she would have later in the day. She was the town doctor in Grace Valley, California, a post she had inherited from her father, Elmer "Doc" Hudson. Elmer was seventy-two and playing at retirement, which was a polite way of saying he didn't keep hours anymore but he stayed in his daughter's business all the time.<p>The need for another full-time doctor to serve the town was becoming more dire every day. June had already talked to several physicians, and so far there hadn't been a fortuitous match. But today John Stone, M.D., was going to interview. He was forty, had attended Stanford University and UCLA Medical, done his OB-GYN residency at Johns Hopkins, worked for eight years in a prestigious women's clinic, then done a second residency in family medicine. He was made to order for Grace Valley. But was Grace Valley made to order for him?</p><p>She tried to picture him, a yuppie from Sausalito. He had probably passed through town while on a wine tasting tour and begun fantasizing about the good life here. The beautiful landscape&#x2014;mountains, valley and ocean&#x2014; seduced more and more transplants from the cities every year. Or perhaps he'd been on a family vacation, doing the bed-and-breakfasts up the coast. But no, she thought, maybe a rich friend from San Francisco had a huge summer place nearby, someone who didn't need to eke out a living from the town. John Stone couldn't have been drawn here for golf or sailing; there was nothing so refined as that around. Hiking and camping, maybe, but only for a true woodsman. So what's he doing here? He'd <i>say </i>he was looking for peace and quiet and beauty and safety, all of which were plentiful in Grace Valley. Apple butter, heirloom quilts, unlocked doors, front porches and pies cooling in kitchen windows. Country life. Decency and simplicity.</p><p>He probably wanted to get his kids out of the dirty city, away from drugs and crime. How would he react to the news that the Coast Ranges and the Trinity Alps were so full of marijuana growers that army helicopters frequently flew just over the treetops, searching? The regular raids in the deep mountain forests made the simple sport of hiking a dangerous endeavor for the newcomer, since you never knew which camps and trails were controlled by drug farmers. Cannabis remained the largest cash crop in California. It was an uncomfortable reality, and it was just up the road.</p><p>As for peace and quiet, June was looking for a little of that herself. Her reason for trying to hire another physician. Obviously.</p><p>She turned off the water and began to towel her hair.</p><p>June had chosen to practice medicine in the small town she grew up in, <i>knowing </i>the challenge of it, knowing it could be more exciting than a city emergency room. She understood the inconvenience all too well&#x2014; she lived it&#x2014;and the sometimes discomfiting intimacy of being close friends with your patients, a thing big-city doctors could afford to avoid. So far all the medical contenders she had spoken to were trying to escape the hard work, long hours, overstimulation and constant demand of their city practices. Each had ultimately decided this wasn't the place for them, for it was a trade-off, one kind of pressure for another, but no less exacting. It took a certain personality to take on the medical needs of a whole town.</p><p>The phone rang. She glanced at the clock: 6:15.</p><p>That was another thing. There was no such thing as being "on call." There was you. Period.</p><p>She reached for the phone, but the damn cordless didn't work. Out of juice. She'd forgotten to plug it in again. With a towel wrapped loosely around her, and hair dripping in stringy tendrils to her shoulders, she made a dash for the kitchen phone.</p><p>The presence of strangers in the living room caused her to yelp in shocked surprise and dive behind the kitchen counter. Then she slowly rose and peeked over the counter into her small living room as the phone rang on. Had she really seen what she had seen? Four people...a man, a woman, two teenagers&#x2014;boy and girl. The woman had a horrible scar running down the left side of her face. It took June a second to realize it was an old wound; the family had not come for help with that. They sat on her sofa, nice as you please, not in any way alarmed by her state of undress.</p><p>The phone continued to ring as she peered over the counter.</p><p>"You the doctor?" the man finally asked.</p><p>"Um, yes. That would be me."</p><p>By their out-of-date clothing and questionable manners, June assumed they were from the backwoods&#x2014;subsistence farmers or mountain people. Since Grace Valley sat at the junction of three counties, it was impossible to tell which one they might be from. She didn't recognize these folks; maybe they'd never before sought medical treatment.</p><p>"Got a problem with the boy, here."</p><p>June tightened her towel and reached for the phone. "Excuse me," she said to the family. "I'll be with you in just a moment." She slid down behind the counter again. "Hello?" she said into the phone.</p><p>"Hi there," her father said. "I thought I'd better call and tell you that some family from back in Shell Mountain stopped George Fuller along the road and asked for directions to your house."</p><p>"Well, what the hell was George thinking?" she whispered fiercely.</p><p>"I don't imagine George thinks much if he can help it."</p><p>"They're here! Let themselves in and took a seat in the living room while I was in the shower!"</p><p>"Mercy. Well...would you like&#x2014;"</p><p>"I'm practically naked! I had to run to the kitchen phone, wearing only a towel!"</p><p>Elmer cackled, a laugh that had a slight wheeze to it, pipe smoking having taken its toll. "I bet they hadn't counted on that."</p><p>"I'm going to kill George!"</p><p>Elmer could hardly speak, he was laughing so hard. "Right now...I'll bet...you wish...you'd plugged in that cordless phone for once."</p><p>Her father seemed to have some simple psychic ability, a talent that did not amuse June at the moment. "Dad, if you see George before I do, tell him I want him to <i>suffer </i>before he dies!"</p><p>"You really need a dog, June. Haven't I been saying so? You want me to come over?"</p><p>"What for? I can handle this now."</p><p>"Okay then. Is tonight meat loaf night?"</p><p>"If I survive the day," she answered, and hung up without saying goodbye. Elmer was going to get a kick out of this a lot longer than she would.</p><p>June made sure her towel was secure, then slowly stood and looked at the family. Dad wore a suit jacket that was probably thirty years old, and Mom wore a hat. They'd put on their Sunday best for a trip to the doctor, but it seemed like they'd had a hard journey. If the man hadn't said his boy needed a doctor, June would have thought the woman was in some need; the scar that marred her face ran deep from her forehead to her chin, across a blind eye that drooped sadly. It looked as if she'd taken an ax in the head. It gave June a headache just to look at it, though obviously the wound was years old. A childhood accident, perhaps.</p><p>The boy must be in bad shape for them to come to her house. She saw he wore one boot and one clean sock. This did not bode well.</p><p>"Let me get dressed, then I'll look at your son. Stay right there, please."</p><p>So much for the peace and tranquility of country life.</p><p>Elmer used to see patients in their home. The office space wasn't an add-on suite or anything like that, just two rooms right in the middle of the house, built that way by the first town doctor. And when a patient had come to the house wearing only one shoe, it had meant the other foot was too swollen. June's training for spotting such things had begun in her childhood.</p><p>Her visitors were the Mulls; a family of very few words. June managed to learn the boy had been stepped on by a jenny&#x2014;a female donkey. The flesh was torn and rotting, and there were an unknown number of broken phalanges and metatarsals. Country people usually did much better than this with their bone settings and poultices. Maybe the boy had some metabolic problem that affected his healing. She would see that he was checked for diabetes.</p><p>"You waited too long on this injury," June told the family, comprised of Clarence Mull, his wife, Jurea, and their children, Clinton, sixteen, and Wanda, thirteen. Clinton was a strapping, handsome youth. In Wanda June could see a beauty that might have been the mother's had she not been so tragically marred. Clarence and Jurea were not young parents; June thought they might be in their fifties. "You have broken bones in the foot, and tissue and muscle damage from walking on it. Not to mention the necrotic flesh around this gash. Didn't it hurt?"</p><p>The boy shrugged. "Yeah, it was pretty bad. But Ma&#x2014;"</p><p>"It's my fault," Jurea said. "I was the one set it. And put on a poultice."</p><p>"And I bet you gave him some serious herbal remedies for the pain&#x2014;his pupils are dilated. You should go easy on that stuff."</p><p>"Works good on the pain though, don't it?" she answered.</p><p>"Too good. It was possible for him to walk on a broken foot and maybe do worse damage. Did you get to my house in a truck or car?"</p><p>"Pickup," said Clarence.</p><p>"You think it could make it as far as either Ukiah or Eureka?"</p><p>He shrugged. "We're slow but steady."</p><p>June gently pulled the sock back over the blackened, swollen foot. "How slow?" she asked.</p><p>The boy answered. "Can't get her up over thirty these days."</p><p>"Well, I have a better idea," June said. "Let me get one of the deputies to give you a lift up to Rockport, to Valley Hospital. You need to see a specialist."</p><p>"I'll get him where he needs to go," Clarence said.</p><p>"We're in a hurry now," she emphasized, going for the phone. "You already knew that or you wouldn't have brought him here at six in the morning."</p><p>"You worried that foot is going dead?" he asked.</p><p>June glanced back at him. A backwoods mountain man who could interpret necrotic tissue into a dead, gangrenous foot? Maybe he was only expressing his own fears. Still...</p><p>"I'm telling you, if you don't get that boy to the hospital, he could lose his foot. Or worse. You wouldn't want that."</p><p>"Specialis...</p></p><h2>Feminist Messages: CODING IN WOMEN&#39;S FOLK CULTURE (Publications of the American Folklore Society.

But she&#39;s crafty enough to have found a squatter&#39;s paradise in an empty TriBeca loft, and a video store job that feeds her passion for old movies. It&#39;s a passion she shares with her favorite customer, Mr. Kelly, a lonely old man who rents the same video over and over. The flick is a noir classic based on a real-life unsolved bank heist and a million missing dollars. It&#39;s called Manhattan Is My Beat. That&#39;s the tape Rune is picking up from Mr. Kelly&#39;s shabby apartment when she finds him shot to death. The police suspect a robbery gone wrong, but Rune is certain the key to solving the murder is hidden somewhere in the hazy, black-and-white frames of Mr. Kelly&#39;s beloved movie. But as Rune hits the mean streets of New York to find answers, she gets caught up in a dangerous adventure more chilling than anything Hollywood could dream up. As her story draws to its terrifying conclusion, Rune&#39;s final close-up may include the killer of a costar.</p><p>Jeffrey Deaver knows how to hook readers and keep them guessing with suspenseful, twisty plots.

Rune and a woman jogger glimpse the presumed killer as he speeds off in a green car. While cops drag their heels in solving the mystery, Rune takes matters into her own hands, convinced that the motive for the murder is a missing suitcase stuffed with one million dollars--the subject, not coincidentally, of the film that Kelly and Rune both admired. An avid fan of fantasy novels and prone to see life through the prism of magic and quests, Rune takes up the challenge of finding the lost money and catching Kelly's killers. But the formidable hit team is intent upon destroying both possible witnesses to the murder, and their nimble crosses and double-crosses--some of which the reader sees, some of which are revealed at the end--make for fun reading.</p><p> Plotting moves briskly in this novel, except for a slowdown in the story--Rune's ambiguous romance with downtown poseur Richard has little to do with catching killers. The conclusion, while neatly wrapped, is marred by the sudden appearance of a crucial detail that Deaver produces like a fancy dish under the waiter's silver dome. But the gimmick to offset the conclusion's predictability feels like a cheat rather than a revelation. All in all, however, the novel is excellent mind candy, a thrilling romp lead by an agile, street-smart heroine. <i>--Kathi Inman Berens</i></p>"Highly original and very entertaining."<br>--<i>Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine</i><br><br>"Deaver writes with clarity, compassion, and intelligence, and with a decidedly human and contemporary slant."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Deaver is a master of ticking-bomb suspense!"<br>--<i>People</i><br><br>Don't miss Jeffery Deaver's other gripping novels featuring his unforgettable heroine Rune:<br><br>"[Rune] is a breath of fresh air!"<br>--<i>Booklist</i><br><br><b>Death of a Blue Movie Star</b><br><br>"Truly an original."<br>--<i>The Drood Review of Mystery</i><br><br><b>Hard News</b><br><br>"Peerless entertainment."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></p><h2>Inside Blues Guitar</h2><p>(String Letter Publishing).

Though once widely known by nicknames such as &#x201c;Manager of the Holocaust,&#x201d; in 1961 he was able to portray himself, from the defendant&#x2019;s box in Jerusalem, as an overworked bureaucrat following orders&#x2014;no more, he said, than &#x201c;just a small cog in Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s extermination machine.&#x201d; How was this carefully crafted obfuscation possible? How did a central architect of the Final Solution manage to disappear? And what had he done with his time while in hiding?<br><br> Bettina Stangneth, the first to comprehensively analyze more than 1,300 pages of Eichmann&#x2019;s own recently discovered written notes&#x2014; as well as seventy-three extensive audio reel recordings of a crowded Nazi salon held weekly during the 1950s in a popular district of Buenos Aires&#x2014;draws a chilling portrait, not of a reclusive, taciturn war criminal on the run, but of a highly skilled social manipulator with an inexhaustible ability to reinvent himself,&nbsp; an unrepentant murderer eager for acolytes with whom to discuss past glories while vigorously planning future goals with other like-minded fugitives. <br><br> A work that continues to garner immense international attention and acclaim, <i>Eichmann Before Jerusalem</i> maps out the astonishing links between innumerable past Nazis&#x2014;from ace Luftwaffe pilots to SS henchmen&#x2014;both in exile and in Germany, and reconstructs in detail the postwar life of one of the Holocaust&#x2019;s principal organizers as no other book has done</p><p><b>Bettina Stangneth</b> wrote her dissertation on Immanuel Kant and the concept of radical evil. Ever since then she has been researching a theory of the lie and has written widely on anti-Semitism in eighteenth-century and National Socialist philosophy. In 2000 she was awarded first prize by the Philosophical-Political Academy, Cologne, and she received the German NDR nonfiction book award for <i>Eichmann Before Jerusalem</i> in 2011. Bettina Stangneth is an independent philosopher and lives in Hamburg, Germany.<br> &nbsp;<br> Translated from the German by Ruth Martin<i>Introduction<br></i><br>Ever since&nbsp;<i>Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil&nbsp;</i>was published in 1963, every essay on Adolf Eichmann has also been a dialogue with Hannah Arendt. A Jew from K�nigsberg who had studied philosophy under Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger until National Socialism drove her out of Germany, Arendt went to Jerusalem in 1961 for Eichmann&#x2019;s trial. Like all philosophers, she wanted to understand. But our understanding is always mediated by our context: we bring to the task our own thoughts and experiences and our own images of the past. Hannah Arendt read about Adolf Eichmann in the newspapers for the first time in 1943 at the latest, and eighteen years later she was familiar with all the research on him. What she expected to find in Jerusalem was something she had already described in detail: a diabolical, highly intelligent mass murderer who commanded a kind of horrified fascination, the kind of murderer seen in great works of literature. &#x201c;He was one of the most intelligent of the lot,&#x201d; she wrote in 1960. Anyone who dared to understand him would be taking a great leap toward understanding the Nazis&#x2019; crimes. &#x201c;Am very tempted.&#x201d;<br><br>Arendt, a philosopher with a gift for acute observation, was not the only person who was puzzled by Eichmann in the flesh. Regardless of where they came from, almost all the trial observers received the same impression: Eichmann-in-Jerusalem was a wretched creature, with none of the scintillating, satanic charisma they had expected. The SS&nbsp;<i>Ober�sturmbannf�hrer&nbsp;</i>who had spread fear and terror and death for millions exhausted the observers&#x2019; attention with his endless sentences, and his talk of acting on orders and taking oaths of allegiance. Shouldn't the fact that he was so astoundingly good at doing so have aroused suspicions, even in 1961? Voices of doubt were present, but they were very quiet and not at all popular. The crucial difference between these voices and the trial observers was that the doubters all had access to at least part of the Argentina Papers.<br><br>In 1960 Holocaust research was in its infancy, documentary evidence was scarce, and the desire to extract information from perpetrators who were brought to trial made people incautious. Hannah Arendt chose the method of understanding that she was familiar with: repeatedly read�ing Eichmann&#x2019;s words and conducting a detailed analysis of the person speaking and writing, on the assumption that someone speaks and writes only when they want to be understood. She read the transcripts of his hearing and the trial more thoroughly than almost anyone else. And for this very reason, she fell into his trap: Eichmann-in-Jerusalem was little more than a mask. She didn&#x2019;t recognize it, although she was acutely aware that she had not understood the phenomenon as well as she had hoped.<br><br>No other book on Adolf Eichmann&#x2014;and probably on National Socialism as a whole&#x2014;has occasioned more debate than&nbsp;<i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>. The book achieved the primary goal of philosophers since Socrates: controversy for the sake of understanding. However, since at least the end of the 1970s, reference to Hannah Arendt has served to distract us from the matter at hand. One cannot help but feel that the story of the trial has stopped being about Eichmann, and that we would rather talk about the debate and various theories of evil than try to dis�cover more about the man himself than a thinker in 1961 could possibly have known. And yet a major development has given us access to other sources entirely&#x2014;at least in theory.<br><br>Since 1979 large parts of the so-called Sassen interviews have become available, and we can now see what Hannah Arendt and all the other trial observers were not allowed to see: Eichmann&nbsp;<i>before</i>Jerusalem, chat�ting in his friend&#x2019;s front room, surrounded by former comrades&#x2014;Nazis in Argentina, just like him. Historians&#x2019; engagement with this wealth of information has, however, remained worryingly brief. They have dis�played some reluctance and a notable lack of curiosity regarding this source, even after some of the original tapes surfaced in 1998. A thor�ough reading of the transcripts alone confirms that more happened in Argentina than just a journalist on the lookout for a story meeting up with a washed-up Nazi on the lookout for a bottle of whiskey, and revel�ing in their memories. If anyone was of a mind to actually argue against Hannah Arendt, rather than continue to lament the success of her book, they could have found plenty of ammunition here. Instead, we go on retelling Eichmann&#x2019;s stories from Israel, referring to the dates he gave, quoting from an insupportable pseudoedition of the transcripts from a tendentious publisher, and leaving unexamined material on Eichmann sitting in archives, wrongly labeled&#x2014;material that could put even the legendarily reactionary stance of historians to the test. And so there is at least one thing we should learn from Hannah Arendt: when faced with the unknown, we should let ourselves be tempted.<br><br>My book is, first, an attempt to present all the available material, as well as the challenges that come with it. Even the story of how the Argentina Papers came to be distributed among several archives, like pieces of a monstrous jigsaw puzzle, gives us an unexpected insight into the &#x201c;Eich�mann phenomenon.&#x201d; And any controversy about this phenomenon is worthwhile. My book presents these sources in detail for the first time, and the route they have taken through history, in the hope that it will enable further research and prompt more questions.<br><i><br>Eichmann Before Jerusalem&nbsp;</i>is also a dialogue with Hannah Arendt, and not simply because I first came to this topic many years ago through&nbsp;<i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>. Our understanding of history is so dependent on our own time and circumstances that we cannot ignore a perspec�tive like Arendt&#x2019;s. She had the courage to form a clear judgment, even at the risk of knowing too little in spite of all her meticulous work. And one of the most significant insights to be gained from studying Adolf Eichmann is reflected in Arendt: even someone of average intelligence can induce a highly intelligent person to defeat herself with her own weapon: her desire to see her expectations fulfilled. We will be able to recognize this mechanism only if thinkers deal bravely enough with their expectations and judgments to see their own failure.<br><br>Having written this book, it remains for me to preface it with a warn�ing, in the same words that Hannah Arendt wrote to a good friend before flying to Jerusalem for the Eichmann trial: &#x201c;It could be interesting&#x2014;apart from being horrible.&#x201d;<br><br>...<br><br><i>Introduction to&nbsp;Chapter 1<br></i><br>To this day, we don&#x2019;t know exactly when Eichmann decided to live in Argentina, but he once explained why he was drawn there: &#x201c;I knew that in this &#x2018;promised land&#x2019; of South America I had a few good friends, to whom I could say openly, freely and proudly that I am Adolf Eichmann, former SS Obersturmbannf�hrer.&#x201d;<br><br>Proud to be Adolf Eichmann? What an extraordinary remark! The fact that Eichmann saw this as a realistic possibility was as grotesque then as it seems now. His name had become a byword for the Nazis&#x2019; extermination of the Jews, as he was all too aware. Nobody goes to great lengths to live under a false name, among strangers, without good rea�son. And when Adolf Eichmann was planning his escape, he had an excellent reason: he was simply too well known to remain undiscovered for long.<br><br>Too many people knew him and knew about his part in the disenfran�chisement, expulsion, and mass murder of the Jews. If this fact is not as clear to us today as it was to Eichmann in the late 1940s, it is due to his extraordinary success in presenting himself in Jerusalem. After being kidnapped in 1960, he did his utmost to paint himself as an unimport�ant head of department, one among many, a &#x201c;small cog in the machine&#x201d; of the murderous Third Reich. He was ultimately an anonymous man who had been &#x201c;made a scapegoat&#x201d; through error, chance, and the cow�ardice of others, an unknown SS officer with no influence to speak of. But Eichmann knew very well that this image was a lie. By no means had his name been known only to a very limited circle of people; nor did it become common currency only during the trial. On the contrary, his reputation played a fundamental part in the enormity of the crime for which Eichmann remains notorious to this day.<br><br>As his name developed into a symbol of the Holocaust, Adolf Eich�mann kept a close watch on it; indeed, both he and his superiors specifi�cally encouraged the development. He wanted to be anything but the &#x201c;man in the shadows&#x201d; that he sometimes claimed to be. Only before the court in Israel did he try to give the impression that he had been a nameless, faceless, disposable minor official&#x2014;but then, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be invisible when threatened with the death penalty? Still, the Eichmann Before Jerusalem idea that Eichmann had been a man in the shadows seemed plausible to many people. Some even saw his invisibility as the key to his mur�derous success. Yet obvious clues tell us that by 1938 at the very latest, Eichmann was neither unknown nor interested in operating behind the scenes. As we follow these clues, a far more colorful picture of this shady character will emerge.<br><br>...<br><br><i>The Ideal Symbol<br></i><br>Adolf Eichmann was not the first person to realize how useful a public image can be. The use of ideals and symbolism was one of the secrets for the Nazi Party&#x2019;s success. Hitler&#x2019;s Mein Kampf also provides a warn�ing never to underestimate the effect of a symbolic figure. Speaking in the 1950s in Argentina, Eichmann would say that wartime was when he had finally become famous: &#x201c;They knew me wherever I went.&#x201d; He even turned up in a book published by some of his comrades in Vienna, though his name was spread largely through his visibility to his victims: &#x201c;Through the press, the name Eichmann had emerged as a symbol. . . . In any case, the word Jew . . . was irreversibly linked with the word Eichmann.&#x201d; And his various official departments with their nondescript and frequently changing names soon just became known as &#x201c;Eichmann&#x2019;s office.&#x201d; These concepts were so powerful that they can be found in witness statements from the Nuremberg trials, along with the term &#x201c;Eichmann&#x2019;s special commando&#x201d; for his representatives abroad. This usage cannot be wholly explained by the fact that Eichmann, unlike many officials in the RSHA, remained in his post throughout the war. He would never have gained this reputation without the public per�formance that went with it, and without that reputation, &#x201c;Eichmann&#x2019;s office&#x201d; would not have had the position of power that it achieved over the years. A single person&#x2019;s influence extends only as far as his arm or his commands can reach. His image, however, can have an impact in places he never goes, provided he finds someone to carry it there&#x2014;even if that someone is his enemy. &#x201c;Much more power . . . was attributed to me than I actually had,&#x201d; Eichmann explained. And &#x201c;this fear&#x201d; of his presumed power meant that &#x201c;everyone felt he was being watched.&#x201d;<br><br>The Nazi Party&#x2019;s concept of power was very personalized, and the rapid success of this concept was repeated further down the organiza�tion. Eichmann and his colleagues quickly learned how useful a F�hrer-like figure can be, as a focal point for gathering power. This was one of his fundamental reasons for not hiding in the shadows or shying away from public displays. The Nazis needed a shop-front sign to which the Jewish question could be &#x201c;irreversibly linked,&#x201d; and Eichmann was the name to fulfill that symbolic function. Eichmann would later try to make this choice look like pure chance&#x2014;a view that surfaces occasion�ally in books and articles on his role. But what other name could even have been considered for the position?<br><br>Eichmann kept a close watch on his growing reputation, and it could not have escaped him that his exploits were becoming increasingly noto�rious. The international press reported on them, and the Nazis went over the press of &#x201c;international Jewry&#x201d; with a fine-tooth comb. Review�ing the press was a reconnaissance mission in a war that was partly being fought with &#x201c;intellectual weapons.&#x201d; Eichmann&#x2019;s significance, both in his own estimation and for his colleagues, grew in direct proportion to the number of plans and campaigns to which he managed to link his name. By this time, many people were also familiar with Eichmann from his appearances at interministry meetings and planning conferences. With all due caution about viewing history through an individual biography, it is surprising how many of the participant lists for important meet�ings feature Eichmann&#x2019;s name. He was involved right from the start, leading experiments&#x2014;like the Vienna Central Office, Doppl, Nisko, the Szczecin deportations, ghettoization, and even the first attempts at mass extermination&#x2014;which can now be seen as prototypes for practices that later became standard. At the notorious Wannsee Conference, Heydrich officially enthroned Eichmann as the coordinator of all interministe�rial efforts toward the &#x201c;final solution of the Jewish question.&#x201d; It was the logical next step for his career. A lunatic project like this required someone who had experience in unconventional solutions, someone who wouldn&#x2019;t get caught up in the usual bureaucratic formalities. Eich�mann&#x2019;s leadership of the Vienna Central Office, and everything that came after, proved he could do just that. He had a talent for organiza�tion, and for making possible things that had never been done before. When others were at a loss, he was the man they called on. For example, a professor at Strasbourg University was adamant that he wanted the &#x201c;skulls of Jewish-Bolshevist Commissars&#x201d; to add to a collection of skel�etons, despite the fact they were still alive. With Eichmann on board, this too could be organized.<br><br>Eichmann enjoyed his reputation for being the man for tricky assign�ments. Even when he was neither the initiator nor the driving force of a project, he still managed to convince others he had originated it. The so-called Madagascar Plan is still linked to his name today, although the original idea was verifiably not his, and he never worked on its details. But still he triumphed: in spite of all evidence to the contrary, even today no one can talk about this resettlement plan without mentioning his name. In later years, when circumstances had changed, Eichmann would make an immense effort to divert attention away from himself and play down his role. But that effort only provides further evidence of the position he had really held during the Nazis&#x2019; glory years. No one would do that unless they had something to hide, and Eichmann did it surprisingly effectively.<br><br>It has therefore taken some time for historians to recognize the sig�nificance of the gigantic eviction and resettlement plans in which Eich�mann played a substantial part. As head of Special Department IV R, he was responsible for &#x201c;the central processing of Security Police matters during the implementation of the eviction in the East.&#x201d; The connections were clearer to Eichmann&#x2019;s contemporaries, as we can see from a report by the Ministry of the Interior, claiming that in September 1941 Eich...</p><h2>Mastering Multiple Position Sex: Mind-Blowing Lovemaking Techniques That Create Unforgettable Orgasms</h2><p><i>Mastering Multiple Position Sex</i> takes the traditional sex manual a step further by outlining entire bedroom scenarios, from seduction to sexplay to positions, including the transitions in between.

In addition to recording the crew's doomed effort to save the ship, Johnston displays great heroism, rescuing many endangered officers and men from the sea and earning the praise of the <i>Lexington</i>'s senior officers. They even recommend him for a medal. Then his story darkens. On board the rescue ship <i>Barnett</i>, Johnston is assigned to a cabin where messages from the Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Chester Nimitz, are routinely, and carelessly, circulated.

They fear Japanese commanders will discover the article, grasp that their code has been cracked, and quickly change it, thereby depriving the U.S. Navy of a priceless military asset. When Navy officials confirm that Johnston wrote the story after residing in that <i>Barnett</i> stateroom, they think they understand the "leak."<br>Drawing on seventy-five-year-old testimony never before released, Carlson takes readers inside the grand jury room where jurors convened by the Roosevelt administration consider charges that Johnston violated the Espionage Act.

The Doctrine of Fascism was written by Benito Mussolini and the Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile. A key concept of which was that fascism was a rejection of previous models: If the 19th century was the century of the individual we are free to believe that this is the &#39;collective&#39; century, and therefore the century of the State . Giovanni Gentile was inspired by Italian intellectuals such as Mazzini, Rosmini, Gioberti, and Spaventa from whom he developed the idea of self-construction , but also was strongly influenced by the German idealist and materialist schools of thought - namely Marx, Hegel, Fichte, and Nietzsche. Gentile was described by Mussolini, as &#39;the philosopher of Fascism&#39;. Alfredo Rocco developed the economic and political theory of corporatism which would become part of the Fascist Manifesto of the National Fascist Party. Rocco denounced the European powers for imposing foreign culture on Italy and criticized the European powers for endorsing too much liberalism and individualism. The Fascist Manifesto was endorsed by a large number of intellectuals, and writers, including Luigi Pirandello, Gabriele D&#39;Annunzio, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Giuseppe Ungaretti.</p><p></p><h2>2006 Taste of Homes Annual Recipes</h2><p>Cookbook filled with recipes.</p><p></p><h2>Dorling Kindersley Illustrated Oxford Dictionary</h2><p>Book by Collectif</p><p></p><h2>Mary Anne Breaks the Rules (Baby-sitters Club)</h2><p>Hoping to provide a male role model for a new charge whose parents&#39; divorce has him missing his father, Mary Anne invites Logan to accompany her baby-sitting jobs and has a lot of explaining to do when Mrs. Kuhn does not understand.

This is a great book, and a wonderful investment in a healthier future for us all.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jeffrey Hollender, CEO, Seventh Generation</p><p>These days, more and more people are saying no to "better living through chemistry" and yes to a lifestyle that is less toxic and more environmentally friendly. This trend toward a more natural lifestyle has become something of a crusade for Annie Berthold-Bond, author of <i>Better Basics for the Home</i>. After developing hypersensitivity to even very low concentrations of chemicals, Berthold-Bond was forced to rid her life of as many toxins as possible. "It wasn't until I <i>had</i> to be away from chemicals that I began to realize how many we lived with. The extent of the contamination is startling--from hair spray and floor wax to dandelion killers and plastic shower curtains and other products that line our hardware stores and supermarket shelves."<p> This book represents the culmination of her search for a more sustainable lifestyle. Taking her cue from an earlier time, Berthold-Bond, former editor in chief of <i>Green Alternatives for Health and Environment</i>, offers more than 800 simple and practical alternatives to common household toxins, covering everything from skin care to gardening. And the good news is that adopting her suggestions and formulas isn't hard at all. "Mixing up face creams or wood stain isn't much different than cleaning the windows with vinegar, soap, and water instead of using Brand Name X, or making a cake with flour, eggs and milk instead of buying a mix," see asserts. "With a few simple staples we can clean our houses, wash our hair, rid the dog's bed of fleas, and do many other things as well." If you have your doubts, here is her formula for metal polish: </p><p> </p><blockquote> 3 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon flour, and enough white distilled vinegar to make a paste. Scoop the paste onto a clean sponge, and polish the metal clean. Rinse with hot water and buff dry. </blockquote><p> Sure, these days it's literally impossible to lead a life that is completely toxin-free. But you can significantly reduce your exposure, and picking up a copy <i>Better Basics for the Home</i> is a great way to get started.</p>The Commonsense Rule of Thumb<br><br>It is a great relief to establish a healthy home. Two-thirds of us cite healthy air and water as an extremely important local priority, second only to safety from crime, according to Roper Starch Worldwide. National Wildlife Federation research has noted that up to 80 percent of us are concerned about how pesticides and indoor air pollution affect our health. Other polls show that a natural lifestyle is one that women, mothers in particular, overwhelmingly want because it protects the health of their families.<br><br>Yet polls ever since Earth Day 1990 consistently show a significant gap between wanting a more healthful environment and knowing how to create it. We are realizing that the government doesn't fully protect us from toxic products, leaving an uneasy and pervasive feeling that we have to take charge of safeguarding our families' health. The stumbling blocks seem insurmountable.<br><br>Having lived in a healthy home for more than a decade, I've learned that after some initial adjustment, the way to establish such a home is quite simple. The most important guideline for choosing safe materials is to follow this basic rule of thumb: Use only materials that have been around so long, and been used by people without harm for so long, that they are "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS for short), otherwise they would have long since been abandoned. Using only GRAS substances will take us back to the time before plastics and forward to new technology using old and safe materials. It will introduce us to plants and healing herbs; minerals such as baking soda, borax, and washing soda; and products from animals and insects such as milk, honey, shellac, and royal jelly. We may not have realized that these natural materials could clean, disinfect, moisturize, or make paint. This discovery will open up a new way of looking at our world.<br>Our alternative is to get a combined degree in toxicology and environmental studies in order to do a simple risk analysis of bathtub cleansers that won't cause harm, or to go shopping armed with research files. That's a stretch for even the most well intentioned among us.<br><br>Help also comes from something we all already have, even if we need to clear out cobwebs to find it, and that is our common sense. If the choice for polishing furniture is between polish in a can that reads "fatal if swallowed" or using a simple but effective recipe of lemon juice and raw linseed oil, common sense and the GRAS rule guide us to the lemon and raw linseed oil.<br><br>Mixing up face creams or wood stain isn't much different than cleaning the windows with vinegar, soap, and water instead of using Brand Name X, or making a cake with flour, eggs, and milk instead of buying a mix. And it seems amazing, although true, that we can make paint ourselves using milk and lime. With a few simple staples we can clean our houses, wash our hair, rid the dog's bed of fleas, and do many other things too.<br><br>Looking for cause and effect is another way of choosing safe products. Sometimes I wonder if we've allowed consumer products to deplete the earth's resources or to be so toxic because the products don't look like the raw materials used to make them. We don't see the connections. A can of pretty robin's-egg blue paint in a hardware store isn't visibly connected to its ingredients of fungicides and petroleum or to the smokestacks of the factory where it was made. Seeing the loss and damage that occurs in its creation might incline us to purchase a more ecological brand or to buy a little less. Or having access to the old-timers' recipe for milk paint might inspire us to try it out ourselves.<br>Just because a formula is old, or its ingredients are natural, doesn't mean it is safe, of course. Some old paint recipes call for white lead. A musty-smelling 1951 housekeeping book I found recently at a yard sale recommended using DDT paint on screens and windows. DDT paint! For those of you not familiar with DDT, it is a pesticide, now banned, that is symbolic of the worst of the industrial age's impact on the environment. Natural materials such as turpentine, citrus solvents, and tung oil can cause health problems for many. Needless to say, we need to look at the old recipes with a discerning eye. The key is to integrate the best of the old-the simplest, most wholesome ingredients and methods-with the best of the new-information about the effect of poisons on our collective health, and how to replace them with safe alternatives.<br><br>Signal Words<br>Besides choosing GRAS materials, the next best way to protect yourself and the world at large from toxic products is to read labels and pay particular attention to "signal words." They are placed on products by order of the federal government, with the primary purpose of protecting you, but sometimes to tell you about the products' potential impact on the environment. POISON/DANGER means some-thing very toxic; only a few drops could kill you. WARNING means moderately toxic; as little as a teaspoonful can kill. CAUTION denotes a product that is less toxic; two tablespoons to a cup could kill you. There are a few others, such as strong sensitizer, which means the product can cause multiple allergies. I'd suggest that everyone get over the "it will never happen to me" way of thinking and read labels, believe them, and simply avoid toxic products. Calamity might not happen to you, but it could happen to a child, or a neighbor, or a fish or a dog.<br>Putting Better Basics into Practice<br><br>Most people have some practical concerns about living without toxic chemicals. Just how much of a change is it going to be? Does living this way take more time? Is it more expensive? How do I begin? My answers to these legitimate questions follow. But basically, I suggest you just jump in and try it. I've never once had a person tell me they've regretted it. Some people want to switch to less toxic living on the spot; others stop restocking toxic cleansers as they run out, learning about the alternatives as they go along. Most start switching to natural body care gradually. Choose any way that will work for you. To make it easier to start the process of changing over, I have placed an icon (#) at particularly easy recipes, hoping this will offer you the encouragement you need to give Better Basics for the Home a try.</p><h2>Hydroponics For Beginners: Essential Hydroponic Gardening Guide</h2><p>Hydroponic gardening is a method for growing plant material for consumption primarily, but can also be used for an aesthetic garden if desired.

Kate was waiting for Rainey Teague and Axel Deitz to come home from Regiopolis Prep. She did this whenever she could, waited on the stairway like this, so Rainey and Axel would see her standing there when they turned the corner. Both boys needed to see someone waiting for them.<br> Axel&#x2019;s mother was working from Mondays to Fridays down in Cap City, as a civilian employee of the FBI, a job engineered for her by Boonie Hackendorff, the Special Agent in Charge and a family friend. -Beth&#x2019;s daughter, Hannah, just turned five, spent the week in Cap City with her mother, at a day care facility maintained for FBI staff. Beth and Hannah made it home on weekends.<br><br> Their father was still in Twin Counties Correctional, awaiting the outcome of a long and complicated federal appeal demanding that he be remanded to Washington, D.C., to face a charge that he had conspired to sell national defense information to a foreign nation, specifically China. Apparently the Chinese government had taken the view that the death of their people was an act of aggression on the part of the U.S. intelligence agencies.<br><br> The matter was being fought out in various jurisdictions, from the State Department and Justice all the way down to the screamers on talk radio. Kate had followed the ins and outs of the case. She felt it could go either way. Byron might get sent to Cap City for a trial, or he could end up on a plane to Beijing, wrapped in heavy chains.<br><br> As for Rainey, his father, Miles, was lying stiff, cold, and dead in the white Greek Revival temple that was the Teague family crypt in the New Hill section of Niceville&#x2019;s Confederate Cemetery. Miles was on the second shelf from the top, just below an ancestor named Jubal Teague, and across the way from Jubal&#x2019;s brother, Tyree Teague. Miles had a small mahogany box tucked under his right hand that contained what little they could find of his head.<br> Jubal and Tyree were the sons of the infamous London Teague. <br><br> He -wasn&#x2019;t there. No one knew where London Teague&#x2019;s body was. No one cared. He was rumored to have died of syphilis in a brothel in Baton Rouge, or possibly it was Biloxi, a bitter old man given to gin and violence.<br><br> London&#x2019;s son Jubal seemed to have lived an honorable life, serving with distinction as a Confederate cavalry officer during the Civil War, the same war that saw his brother, Tyree, cut down by Union grapeshot at Front Royal.<br> Jubal Teague went on to become the father of a deeply unpleasant man named Abel Teague. Deeply unpleasant men seemed to reappear in the Teague line fairly often. Like his grandfather London&#x2019;s, Abel Teague&#x2019;s body was not in the family crypt either, for roughly the same reasons.<br><br> Kate had undertaken an informal study of the Teague line, keeping her interest a secret from Nick, whose instinctive unease around Rainey had, over time, receded, or had appeared to recede. She had no desire to have that unease flare up again. So here she was, standing on the landing, waiting for the last of the Teagues to come down Beauregard Lane. And there they were.<br><br> Her heartbeat jumped a groove, like a needle in an old vinyl record, but she calmed herself. Lately she had been doing a lot of that. Two weeks ago, she&#x2019;d gotten a -heads-up call from Alice Bayer, Delia Cotton&#x2019;s -ex--housekeeper. Nick had gotten Alice a job as attendance secretary at Regiopolis.<br><br> Alice had called to say that Rainey and Axel had been skipping a lot of classes lately, and she wanted to know if there was anything she could do to help, because &#x201c;she -really felt for those young men, for what they&#x2019;d both been through.&#x201d;<br><br> This was very much on -Kate&#x2019;s mind as she watched the boys coming up the sidewalk. They were wearing baggy gray slacks and white shirts, each with a sky-blue-and-gold-striped tie and a navy blue blazer with a gold pocket crest, a crucifix bound up in roses and thorns, the insignia of Regiopolis Prep. This was the Regiopolis school uniform, a uniform Rainey had worn since he was four, but Axel had only recently acquired.<br><br> About Rainey, the Jesuits at Regiopolis Prep and the therapists from the Belfair and Cullen County Child Protection Agency and the doctors and the various law enforcement agencies involved in the Rainey Teague -Case&#x2014;-it was one of those cases that seemed to demand -capitals&#x2014;-had all agreed that, after the emotional trauma he had been through, what Rainey Teague needed most was continuity and predictability.<br><br> Rainey had grown two inches in the last months, and his physiotherapy had ended weeks ago. Now he was a strong, fit young boy. Axel adored him, as younger brothers sometimes worship older brothers. Axel felt that Rainey could do no wrong. Kate hoped he was right.<br><br> Rainey and Axel reached the foot of the steps, heads down, immersed in a low and, from the sound of it, intense conversation, neither of them seeing Kate standing there.<br><br> Kate was about to speak when she caught a flash of green over in the square, in a patch of slanting sunlight, by the sparkling fountain.<br><br> A woman was standing there, in a white dress, or perhaps a nightgown, looking back at her.<br><br> By some trick of the afternoon light through the trees, the air around her had a greenish glow, as if she were standing inside a swirling cloud of emerald sparks. The woman was thin, and looked as if she had been ill for a long time, but she had glossy black hair. Her face looked familiar, as if Kate had seen her once, in a dream, or perhaps an old movie. The woman was very still and seemed to be staring intently at the house.<br><br> Kate was overcome with a strong sense of d�j� vu. A name floated up into her consciousness.<br><br> <i>Anora Mercer<br></i><br> A tremor ran through her body. Not fear. Painful regret? Vertigo? Was she losing her mind?<br><br> Kate lifted a hand to her, and the -woman&#x2014;-if she was there at -all&#x2014;-raised her hand in response.<br><br> Kate almost called out to her.<br><br> A wind stirred the trees around her and the sunlight shimmered into a translucent green shadow and when it steadied again the image was gone.<br><br> Kate heard Axel call her name, and when she looked back down at him, he was staring up at her.<br><br> Her smile faltered and died away.<br><br> &#x201c;Axel, you look terrible. What happened?&#x201d;<br><br> Axel tilted his head and looked at her through his long brown hair, his eyes dark with anger. His shirttail was hanging out and the knees of his slacks were stained with mud.<br><br> Kate came down the stairs and took him by the shoulders. He was vibrating like a plucked string. When he opened his mouth to speak, Kate saw blood on his teeth. She looked over at Rainey, who was standing over Axel with a protective arm laid across the smaller boy&#x2019;s shoulders.<br><br> &#x201c;He had a fight with Coleman Mauldar,&#x201d; said Rainey. Kate felt her heart sink.<br> Coleman Mauldar was the only child of the mayor of Niceville, a jovial and ruthless man whom everybody called Little Rock.<br><br> Coleman was barely fourteen, but thanks to the roulette wheel of genetics, sixty pounds heavier and a foot taller than either Rainey or Axel, strong and quick, a gifted athlete, full of charm and mischief. He and his followers, Jay Dials and Owen Coors, had been making Rainey&#x2019;s school days a misery ever since he had been abducted a year and a half ago. Now that Axel was living with him, Axel was getting his share of the abuse.<br><br> &#x201c;What happened, Rainey?&#x201d;<br><br> Axel wiped his face, straightened his back, cut in before Rainey could speak.<br><br> &#x201c;They were calling him Crypt Boy again. So this time I smacked him one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We got into a fight with them,&#x201d; said Rainey. &#x201c;But it -didn&#x2019;t last long.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Father Casey broke it up.

In this series of thick-paged books (ideal for recent board book graduates) Pippo, a stuffed monkey, is toddler Tom's constant companion. He tumbles with him into a puddle during a winter walk, reads with him when Tom's father is too tired for the job and silently takes the blame for the mess Tom makes when he "helps" his father paint the house. Children will identify all too well with Tom's anxious moments as Pippo faces a spin in the washing machine; Mom provides plenty of sympathetic reassurance. Black-and-white line drawings alternate with uncluttered full-color illustrations; in most pictures there is an expressiveness in Pippo's face worth watching, whether he is frowning as he is stuffed into the washing machine or reaching down longingly from the clothesline towards Tom's outstretched arm. The stories occasionally strain for a resolutionwhich is forgivable, given the brevity of each bookbut they are right on target for this age level and sure to captivate their intended audience. Ages 2-5. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-K-- Four delightful books with single concepts developed through the simple texts. Tom and his stuffed monkey, Pippo, get into the types of mischief that children are bound to find. In the first book, Tom and Pippo play in the mud and get dirty; Tom is put in the bathtub and Pippo goes into the washing machine and is hung on the line to dry. In the second, they go for a walk and get dirty. In the next, the two of them watch Tom's dad paint a room, and they make a mess when they help. In the fourth book, the father reads to Tom and Pippo, and in turn Tom reads to Pippo and falls to sleep musing that he "hopes one day Pippo can read on his own." Brightly washed illustrations show the two friends realistically drawn. These are comfortable books for lap reading to young audiences, and the large, clear typeface is well chosen for children who are just beginning to read. They will surely want to hear the stories again and again (and to tell the stories themselves). These are well designed and appealing books. --Sharron McElmeel, Cedar Rapids Community Schools, Iowa<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The complete guide to growing berries &amp; grapes</h2><p>This paper bound guide is full of hard-to-find information on the subject of growing berries and grapes.</p><p></p><h2>The Roman Guide to Slave Management: A Treatise by Nobleman Marcus Sidonius Falx</h2><p>Having spent most of his life managing his servants&#x2015;many of them prisoners from Rome&#x2019;s military conquests&#x2015;he decided to write a kind of owner&#x2019;s manual for his friends and countrymen. The result, The Roman Guide to Slave Management, is a sly, subversive guide to the realities of servitude in ancient Rome. Cambridge scholar Jerry Toner uses Falx, his fictional but true-to-life creation, to describe where and how to Romans bought slaves, how they could tell an obedient worker from a troublemaker, and even how the ruling class reacted to the inevitable slave revolts. Toner also adds commentary throughout, analyzing the callous words and casual brutality of Falx and his compatriots and putting it all in context for the modern reader. Written with a deep knowledge of ancient culture&#x2015;and the depths of its cruelty&#x2015;this is the Roman Empire as you&#x2019;ve never seen it before.</p><p>Jerry Toner is Fellow and Director of Studies in Classics at Churchill College, Cambridge. He is the author of The Roman Guide to Slave Management.<p></p><p>Copyright</p><p></p><p></p><p>FOREWORD</p><p></p><p>I HAVE NEVER COME ACROSS Marcus Sidonius Falx before, but I know his type. The Roman world had plenty of people just like him who owned huge numbers of slaves and who, for most of the time, did not give slavery a second thought. It was completely normal, a natural part of the social order. But the Romans did think about slaves in their own way: how they could control them, and how best to show them off to their friends. And the smarter ones (and that might include Falx here) could actually be a bit scared. They worried about what the slaves were up to behind their backs, and where the battle lines of ancient Roman culture were drawn. &#x2018;All slaves are enemies&#x2019; ran one famous Roman slogan, well known to Falx. And on a notorious occasion in the reign of the emperor Nero, a Roman plutocrat was murdered by one of his 400 household slaves. It didn&#x2019;t, as you will see, make Falx rest entirely easy in his bed, but the whole household was put to death as punishment.</p><p>I am a bit surprised that Falx and Toner got on so well. Falx is an aristocrat whereas Toner&#x2019;s family &#x2013; so he assures me &#x2013; has its roots in those classes oppressed by the British elite (&#x2018;from an Irish potato field&#x2019; I&#x2019;m told). But it is to the credit of both of them, I guess, that they seem to have hit it off, despite their political differences. Of course, there were slave owners of a very different sort from Falx, There were thousands of small traders and craftsmen who owned just one or two slaves. And very many of them were freed &#x2013; and actually married those who had once been there owners, both male and female. Even in Falx&#x2019;s league, there were a few favored slave secretaries and PA&#x2019;s who lived better than poor free Romans trying to make a living on day labour at the docks, or selling cheap flowers in the Forum. Interestingly some of the free poor got onto the streets to demonstrate, unsuccessfully, against the (strictly legal) punishment of those 400 slaves. But Falx is talking about the use of mass slave labour.</p><p>It is hard for us now to understand all the dimensions of the relations between free, and slave, and ex-slave (and it was hard then). But we do have a few glimpses of what the rich Romans thought of their ordinary slave-workers; and Falx is one of the most reliable guides we have to what Romans would have seen as a proud tradition of &#x2018;slave management&#x2019;. He is trying to help everyone share the benefits of his wisdom, and he is a good place to learn.</p><p>Thankfully the world has moved on. But his text offers an authentic insight &#x2013; as authentic as you can get &#x2013; into a fundamental aspect of life in Rome and its empire. If it had been published 2,000 years ago it would have topped the management charts. Modern readers may have trouble mastering their prejudices; but underneath the buoyant rhetoric, they&#x2019;ll maybe find Falx not a wholly bad man, by the standards of his day at least.</p><p>And Falx points the finger at us too. Do some of his insights still help us manage our own &#x2018;staff&#x2019;. For are we sure that &#x2018;wage-slaves&#x2019; are really so much different from &#x2018;slaves&#x2019;? How different are we from the Romans?</p><p>Mary Beard</p><p><i>Cambridge, April 2014</i></p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p></p><p>MY NAME IS MARCUS SIDONIUS FALX, of noble birth, whose great-great-grandfather held a consulship, and whose mother hails from an ancient senatorial lineage. Our family was given the name Falx &#x2013; &#x2018;the Claw&#x2019; &#x2013; for our stubborn refusal to let anything go. I served with distinction in the Legio VI &#x2018;Ironclad&#x2019; for five years, campaigning mostly against troublesome oriental tribes, before returning to Rome to run my affairs and my substantial estates in Campania and the province of Africa. My family has owned countless slaves for countless generations. There is nothing we do not know about the management of them.</p><p>In order to write for a non-Roman audience I have been compelled to use the services of a certain Jerry Toner, a teacher in one of our miserable northern provinces, who knows something of our Roman ways but shares few of our virtues. Indeed a man so soft I have never encountered outside the servile class: he has not once fought in battle, can scarce drink a small amphora of watered wine, and even stoops so low that he himself will clean his baby&#x2019;s backside rather than leave such foul tasks to the slaves and womenfolk. He is, however, most blessed to be married to a wife of great beauty and intellect (though she is perhaps more forward with her opinions than a woman ought to be), to whom I am most grateful for ensuring that the meaning of my text is clear for you barbarian readers.</p><p>Marcus Sidonius Falx</p><p><i>Rome, pridie Idus Martias</i></p><p>COMMENTATOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p></p><p>MARCUS SIDONIUS FALX&#x2019;S existence may be the subject of academic debate, but the reality of his opinions is beyond doubt. They provide a Roman&#x2019;s-eye view of slavery. Slavery was a core institution of the Roman world for the whole of its existence. It was so central that it never occurred to anyone that it might not exist. Owning slaves was as normal as voting Republican in Texas or Democrat in New York. We have to remember that slavery was seen as acceptable in the USA and Britain until only two centuries ago. Even freedom-loving Founding Fathers, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, owned slaves themselves. Falx&#x2019;s guide tries to let us understand something of the mentality of that thankfully long-gone world.</p><p>Sadly, we don&#x2019;t know what the Romans&#x2019; slaves thought themselves, because their views didn&#x2019;t matter. But we know plenty about what their Roman masters thought of them. The substance of Marcus&#x2019;s words survives in a variety of Roman texts on slavery, although he has not followed them slavishly. These sources are often obscure or quite hard to interpret. This single text is his clear and simple manual for managing slaves the Roman way. Needless to say the fact that I have helped bring it to publication does not mean I approve of it.</p><p>Marcus has been a difficult author to work with. He holds many strong and unpalatable views which he refuses to acknowledge may be wrong or immoral. But by Roman standards, Marcus was a decent man. His text shows how the Roman world, for all its apparent familiarity, can be almost casually shocking. It also shows how complex an institution was slavery.</p><p>Marcus has refused to reveal his age: his opinions are often an amalgam of views from across the centuries, although he appears to have taken them mostly from the Empire of the first and second centuries AD. I have added brief commentaries to his words at the end of each chapter to give some context to his advice and (at least partly for the sake of my own reputation) to contradict some of his more unreconstructed views. These, with the further reading at the end of the book, will point those who are interested in digging deeper towards the underlying primary sources and modern discussions.</p><p>Jerry Toner</p><p><i>Cambridge, July 2014</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>BE THE MASTER</p><p></p><p>A REMARKABLE THING happened to me in the gardens of my villa some months ago. It was an event so strange and thought-provoking that it caused me to write this book. I happened to be entertaining a guest from one of the German tribes, an Alan to be precise. You may well wonder what a man of my rank was doing playing host to a miserable barbarian, but this man was no normal German. He was a prince who had come to our great city of Rome as part of an embassy to the emperor. Tired of having to find small talk concerning the benefits of trousers, and other such tedious issues which interest their sort, our great leader had asked me to house his foreign visitor until his return to that foul swamp he calls home.</p><p>We were taking a casual walk in the extensive parterre at the back of my villa and I was explaining to my guest, in simple Latin so as not to confuse him, what various mythological heroes the many marble statues represented. Then this happened. Concentrating my attention on the statuary, I failed to notice a small hoe lying in the pathway. As I stood on the metal end, the wooden handle sprang up into my shins, causing me to cry out, more in alarm than pain. A certain slave, who was standing nearby and whose tool it was, smirked as he saw me hop about on one leg. Naturally I was outraged that this worthless idiot, a man who is himself nothing more than a tool that can speak, should laugh at his master&#x2019;s mishap. I summoned the bailiff.</p><p>&#x2018;This slave thinks that injuries to the leg are amusing. Let us break his legs and see how much he laughs.&#x2019;</p><p>That wiped the smile from his face. Ignoring the pitiful begging which slaves always resort to when faced with their just deserts, the bailiff and two sturdy attendants pulled the man down to the ground, while a fourth ran over with a heavy iron bar. Just as he was raising the implement above his head, my barbarian guest cried out, &#x2018;No!&#x2019;</p><p>Turning to confront him, I saw that he was as white as a freshly sulphured toga.</p><p>&#x2018;What is the matter?&#x2019;</p><p>He hesitated. I pressed him:</p><p>&#x2018;Surely you would treat your slaves the same way?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We do not have slaves,&#x2019; was his extraordinary reply.</p><p>Imagine that? A society without slaves! Who has ever heard of such a thing! How would it function? Who would perform the basest tasks, those that are beneath even the lowest-born free man? What would you do with all those captives acquired in wars of conquest? How would you display your wealth? With my mind turning over all these imponderable questions, I found my anger softening.</p><p>&#x2018;Please, master, I beg you ...&#x2019; whimpered the slave.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh all right ...&#x2019;</p><p>I told the bailiff to stop and let the slave off with a light beating with rods. I know, I know, I am too soft. But so many owners today are far too quick to punish their slaves brutally for very minor offences. It is always better to count to ten before you act.</p><p>Leading my troubled guest back towards the house, it occurred to me that this German barbarian might not be alone in being unused to owning slaves. With so many in the world now addicted to vulgar equality, it became clear to me that people no longer understand how to treat their slaves and underlings properly. I decided, therefore, to set down the principles with which any free person can ensure the efficient running of their attendants.</p><p>This is a vitally important task. The man who devotes himself to personal advancement through the acquisition of power and wealth should understand everything that will help him in this endeavour. It never ceases to amaze me how many in authority today have no inkling of how best to treat those who are so fortunate as to serve them in their ambition. Instead, desperately seeking to ingratiate themselves with those whose loyalty should be in no doubt, they fawn and pander to even the lowest sort of humanity. I have even seen a leading politician smile warmly at a woman working in the street in a pathetic attempt to win her worthless support. Knowledge of how to treat the basest in society, which can be acquired from the careful study of this work, will, by contrast, provide the wherewithal to achieve glory. It will teach the means to attain the goal of a household that is fully in accord with its master&#x2019;s wishes. This will provide a secure power base from which to rise in society. The book will impart the social skills with which to command those who will come to report to you as your reputation burgeons. Accordingly, any attentive head of a household, whose heart is set on pursuing a leadership role, is strongly advised to take special pains to consult my work, which is the fruit of one of the most experienced heads of the ancient past.</p><p>I believe that there is a science of how to be a master, which proves that running a household and controlling slaves is the same as being a leader in wider society. Whether leaders and masters are not also born is impossible to answer with any certainty. Some Greeks have argued that all men differ from each other according to their inner natures. Those who do manual, physical work are slavish by nature, and it is better for them to come under the control of people such as myself who are in possession of natures of a higher sort. For a man who is capable of belonging to another person is, by nature, a slave; and that is why, the argument goes, such a man belongs to someone else. Nature, they say, clearly also intended to make the bodies and souls of free men different to those of slaves. Slaves have bodies that are strong and well suited to the kind of physical services they have to do. Their souls are less capable of reasoning. The bodies of free men, by contrast, are upright and not much use for that kind of manual work. But their souls are intelligent. They are suited for the purposes of partaking in the life of the community, whether it be political or military. Of course, nature sometimes makes mistakes and the opposite happens &#x2013; slaves are given the bodies of free men, free men only the souls and not the bodies of free men. But on the whole, the Greeks said, nature does not make mistakes. She makes sure that each is allotted a nature suitable to his fate in life.</p><p>But most Romans disagree with this. They believe that controlling another human being is contrary to nature. So many of us Romans who continue to rule a great empire are now descended from slaves that it would be ridiculous to believe that slaves are inherently useless. Roman thinkers argue that it is only social convention that leads one man to own another as a slave. They say that there is no natural difference between the two. It is a simple injustice, one that is based on the use of force. They also rightly point out that many slaves have acted in a brave and noble way during times of great crisis, which shows that they are not all slavish by nature. And if slavery is not natural then neither is being a master. It must be learnt!</p><p>Rome is full of slaves. I have heard it said that as many as one in three or four of the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula are in servitude. Even in the vast expanse of the empire as a whole, whose population cannot fall far short of 60 or 70 million persons, perhaps as many as one in eight is a slave. Nor are these slaves only to be found in the rural areas. Rome is teeming with every kind of slave activity and its servile population is as high as anywhere. Perhaps a million live in the capital city, and some claim that at least a third of them are slaves. While such estimates represent little more than the informed guesswork of those with overactive imaginations, it tells you how important an institution slavery is for the Roman world. We Romans need our slaves.</p><p>You may well ask how this situation came about. What were the advantages in using slaves instead of free labour? Let me explain. In the past, during the republic, whenever the Romans had conquered a region of Italy, they took part of the land for themselves and populated it with Roman settlers. They intended these colonies to act as garrison towns. But much land was left empty and unfarmed as a result of the fighting. This was either because the owners had been killed or had fled while fighting in the army against us Romans.

Why is it so hard? The capacity to love is in everyone. Yet so often it remains trapped and waiting to be released. In John Powell&#39;s best-selling Why Am I Afraid to Love, he carefully and sensitively confronts the barriers that restrain. He looks at the fear of rejection, the motives for love, how to truly understand the inner self and what true love looks like. He then considers the true test of love: can self be forgotten in loving others? Based on the original best-selling edition, this new book has been completely re-designed. A fitting companion to Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am?, it is one of the most original and popular self help books on the market. It sits comfortably alongside other classics like I&#39;m OK, You&#39;re OK. Why Am I Afraid to Love has sold over 100,000 copies in its original edition.</p><p>1 Man&#x2019;s invitation to love The word religion is derived from a Latin word religare, which means to bind back. By his practice of religion man binds himself back to God who is his alpha (origin) and omega (destiny). To anyone who is familiar with the New Testament there can be no doubt that the essential act of religion and the essential bond between man and his God is love. When Jesus was asked by the Pharisees: &#x2018;Which is the greatest commandment?&#x2019; he answered: &#x2018;You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment. The second resembles it: You must love your neighbour as yourself.&#x2019; (Matthew 23:35&#x2013;39) What does it mean to love God with one&#x2019;s whole heart, soul and mind? I think that St John would answer this question by telling us that before anyone can really give his heart, soul and mind to God, he must first know how much God has loved him, how God has thought about him from all eternity, and desired to share his life, joy and love with him. Christian love is a response to God&#x2019;s infinite love, and there can be no response until one has somehow perceived that God has first loved him, so much so that he sent his only-begotten Son to be our salvation. More than this, God does not simply have love; he is love. If giving and sharing with another is the character and essence of love, then God is love. He can acquire nothing because he is God. He needs nothing because he is God. He has all goodness and all riches within himself. But goodness is self-diffusive; it seeks to share itself. So the infinite goodness which is God seeks to communicate, to diffuse, to share itself... with you... with me... with all of us. We know something of this love in our own instincts to share that which is good and is our possession: good insights, good news, good rumours. Perhaps the best analogy in our human experience is that of the young married couple, very much in love and very much alive because of that love, wishing to share their love and life with new life which it is in their power to beget. But it is even more than this with God who tells man: if the mother should forget the child of her womb I will never forget you! It is precisely this that is the point of most failures to love God truly. Most of us are not deeply aware of his fatherly, even tender, love. It is especially the person who has never experienced a human love, with all of its life-giving effects, who has never been introduced to the God who is love through the sacrament of human love, that stands at a serious disadvantage. The God of love who wishes to share his life and joy will probably seem like the product of an overheated imagination &#x2013; unreal. There is no human being who will not eventually respond to love if only he can realize that he is loved. On the other hand, if the life and world of a person is marked by the absence of love, the reality of God&#x2019;s love will hardly evoke the response of his whole heart, soul and mind. False gods before us The God who enters such a life will be a fearsome and frowning idol, demanding only fear of his devotees. The Book of Genesis tells us that God has made us to his image and likeness, but it is the most perduring temptation of man to invert this, to make God to his human image and likeness. Each of us has his own unique and very limited concept of God, and it is very often marked and distorted by human experience. Negative emotions, like fear, tend to wear out. The distorted image of a vengeful God will eventually nauseate and be rejected. Fear is a fragile bond of union, a brittle basis of religion. It may well be that this is why God&#x2019;s second commandment is that we love one another. Unselfish human love is the sacramental introduction to the God of love. Man must go through the door of human giving to find the God who gives himself. Those who do not reject such a distorted image will limp along in the shadow of a frown, but they certainly will not love with their whole heart, soul and mind. Such a God is not lovable. There will never be any trust and repose in the loving arms of a Father; there will never be any mystique of belonging to God. The person who serves out of fear, without the realization of love, will try to bargain with God. He will do little things for God, make little offerings, say little prayers, etc. to embezzle a place in the heaven of his God. Life and religion will be a chess-game, hardly an affair of love. Response to God&#x2019;s love The person who is open to the realization of God&#x2019;s love will want to make some response of his own love. How can he make a meaningful response if this God cannot acquire and needs nothing? St John points out the place of human response: We know what love is from the fact that Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. We, too, ought to lay down our lives for our brothers... Beloved, let us love one another, because love takes its origin in God, and everyone that loves is a child of God and knows God. He who has no love does not know God, because God is love... No one has ever seen God, yet if we love one another, God abides in us and our love for him reaches perfection.

This fact has largely been overlooked by both motorcycle buffs and historians. Dedicated bike enthusiasts tend to focus solely on the machine, forgetting that the motorcycle more than any other vehicle is inseparable from its operator. In motion, the two are interdependent, like Siamese twins. Historians tend to treat both rider and machine as quaint sideshows, like the clown at a rodeo or the cartoon before the feature. Yet, as readers can judge for themselves, in the theatre of conventional warfare the motorcycle and rider formed as much a part of the feature as the tanks and infantry, the bombs and bullets, and the dead and survivors. This book is not a review of Canada&#39;s military role in the twentieth century. Instead, it is an attempt to fill in some of the motorcycle and rider &#34;missing links&#34; apparent in the documentation of that history. Military motorcyclists were not usually part of prominent combat units. They were often attached to non-divisional troops such as the signals and service units, which in turn were assigned to larger formations as needed. While a regiment&#39;s history can be traced with relative ease, Despatch Riders (DRs) and other military motorcyclists became lost in the paper work they delivered with such dedication. In 1985, spurred into action out of a mutual interest in vintage motorcycling, the authors began collecting snippets of information scattered throughout countless books, dusty war diaries and memories of military riders. Originally the authors had hoped to gather enough data to put together a cursory look at the Canadian military bike. But during the six years they ended up investing into the work, it developed into much more. The authors observed an overwhelming feeling among the veterans who answered pleas for information that the DR&#39;s contribution to the nation had been for the most part ignored. The authors could not help but agree. &#34;It is not our intention to glorify these soldiers or the wars they participated in,&#34; the authors state in the preface. &#34;The futility of humanity&#39;s conflicts is readily apparent. What is perhaps not so obvious is that when the veterans in this book went to war, they did so firmly believing that what they were doing was right, that the sacrifices they made were for the benefit of future generations, generations to which we the authors and our children belong. The close comradeship that evolves from facing death with a friend, the strength of a nation united in cause, the sheer right of it all may never be duplicated in a nuclear age. Those who survived the wars brought back memories framed in time and injuries to a world that would not, and could not, understand.&#34; So the authors aimed for two goals with this book: to document the history of the military motorcycle and rider in a manner more accurate and detailed than any effort to cover the subject to date, regardless of the nation addressed, and to say thanks. No glory, just thanks. And in 1994, The Winged Wheel Patch won the Canadian International Motorcycle Show Motorcycle Awards for Excellence in Journalism. Printed on quality paper, this 8 1/2&#34; X 11&#34; hardcover book contains 112 photos and drawings (including sketches from famed Canadian war artist Alex Colville), many which have never before been published. The authors&#39; text is complimented with plentiful quotes from official war dairies, regimental histories, and the riders themselves, all fully indexed and footnoted.

The bikes came equipped with acetylene lamps, which the riders used on return trips from the front, although the practice was against regulations. When a guard or officer stopped them and demanded they snuff out the light, a button operated igniter, another popular DR installed illegal option, would shoot a spark across the lamp&#39;s burner, instantly re-lighting the lamp once past the guard post. Lamps were never used when riding towards the front as the bright glare was an easy target for the enemy. For health reasons, many DRs took up smoking. The troops along the road could hear the bikes coming, but it was often too dark for either party to see. So the troops would watch for the approaching glow of a cigarette, then scurry out of the way. DRs learned to watch for three glows advancing towards them, which meant a gun carriage or an ammunition wagon with its three teams of horses was coming down the road. Each team had a rider smoking a cigarette. If it rained, everybody was on their own. --- Although it was popular to portray a daring DR speeding along with his head tucked down close to the fuel tank, experienced riders of the First World War tended to ride erect, watching for signs of the enemy. On frequently travelled routes, the rider knew which corners he would likely be fired upon, and noted the intervals between falling shells, adjusting his speed accordingly. --- Bert Bennes &#34;A motorcycle wouldn&#39;t last two months. But DRs were the biggest bunch of thieves. Some officers had an inside track to the supply column. They were getting brand-new motorcycles even though they weren&#39;t entitled to them. If they left those motorcycles without a guard on them, we&#39;d steal them. One time we heard that two officers were having a beer so four of us went to this town, two fellows on each machine. Casually, the two extra men hopped onto the officers&#39; motorcycles and away they went back to HQ. We worked all night dismantling those motorcycles. &#34;One fellow needed a rear wheel, one fellow the handlebars, another a front wheel, another a gearbox. The next day there was a message &#39;Two motorcycles stolen from such and such a place&#39; with the numbers. But we&#39;d file the numbers off, throw our bashed up pieces into the canal and have new parts. That&#39;s the way we kept the motorcycles going.&#34; --- Between the Wars The number of motorcycles was small, yet their presence was disproportionately high when compared to the more expensive machines of war. Much variety in brand was evident, with appearances being made by BSAs, Hendee Indians, Harley-Davidsons, Nortons, and Scotts. Use of privately owned vehicles was encouraged, although rarely compensated for, which added to the menagerie of makes. Those who turned out for training between the wars were at the very least dedicated, for neither their government nor fellow countrymen showed much interest. --- The Second World War Canada had a scant 14 tanks when war was declared. Initial recruits made do with improvised uniforms, rifles, and precious little ammunition or transport. The 17th Duke of York Royal Canadian Hussars, 3rd Motorcycle Regiment, received their first official shipment of motorcycles, two sidecar units, on September 9, 1940, almost one year to the day after Canada had declared war. --- Mornings were spent in the classrooms learning the fine points of map reading and motorcycle mechanics. Afternoons were spent on the bikes, riding on good roads, secondary roads, cross-country, through ditches and over hills. To get riders used to riding in total darkness, during night exercises the headlights were gradually taped over until only the regulation slit was left to light a trainee&#39;s way. --- Owing to the limited carrying-capacity of a motorcycle, the rider was not as well equipped to defend himself from enemy attack as other Canadian soldiers. In England, riders carried a Smith and Wesson .38 or Enfield Mk 1 .38 revolver, but this was upgraded to either a Sten gun or Thompson machine gun prior to the invasion of Europe, except for the Provost Corps which continued to carry revolvers. Unfortunately, the Sten gun had a reputation for discharging occasionally when the motorcycle hit a bump, and a rider under fire usually couldn&#39;t afford the time to stop and set up the Thompson, so it was not uncommon to see non-Provost riders switching back to revolvers. Some continued to favour the Thompson, though, as it was reportedly good for opening wine barrels. --- Canada&#39;s unique position of being both a part of the British Commonwealth and a neighbour and close ally of the U.S. allowed it the enviable opportunity to make use of motorcycles from both bike producing countries. The Norton 16H, BSA M20 and Harley-Davidson WLC were the mainstays of Canadian riders. The Ariel, Indian (especially in sidecar guise), Matchless G3L, Royal Enfield and Triumph 3HW also saw some service in the Canadian forces. Midway through the war, 10 Simplex Servicycles were employed in dispatch duties within London. The Welbike, a collapsible machine designed to be dropped by parachute, saw limited official use by the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and even more limited unofficial use by a few RCAF personnel on joy rides. --- The English bikes were considerably lighter and had more ground clearance than their US counterparts and were therefore the preferred mount for cross-country riding. The US makes were at their best on smoother roads in convoy and DR duty. --- There is not much that can be said about the short-lived battle [for Hong Kong] or aftermath here except that as the enemy pushed hard, the troops fought back with obsolete equipment in need of repair, and when ammunition ran out, they threw stones. Through all this, Lionel Speller, a DR with the RCCS, continued to ride his BSA delivering messages, riding over rough terrain, sometimes with one hand so that he could return fire from snipers with the other. For his efforts, he became one of the few Canadian DRs serving in the Second World War to be awarded the Military Medal. --- Lord Haw Haw, the Nazi radio announcer, was reported to have said that the Canadian soldier did not worry the Axis-aligned nations as they knew how to deal with the rebellious lot. &#34;Just give them a bottle of whisky and a motorcycle and they will kill themselves.&#34; --- Through the Falaise Gap in France, even with the enemy in retreat, the troops could advance only if transport was able to keep pace, which transport could do only if guided by the DRs. Troops were under daily bombings, occasionally even by Allied planes. And, of more a more serious nature to some, European brothels were placed &#34;out of bounds.&#34; --- &#34;The convoy broke into fragments repeatedly, and it was only by the superhuman efforts of the DRs and RPs (Regimental Police) that any coherence at all was maintained.. Some of the DRs had to be relieved on their job because they were literally blinded by dust. We had been driving for three days and nights without rest and taking pills to stay awake.&#34; --- The enemy set traps specifically aimed at bagging a DR--telephone lines strung across roads at neck height, oil poured over paved corners, abandoned motorcycles booby-trapped, even horse manure was strategically placed in hopes of catching an inattentive DR off guard. With no signs and few points of reference still standing, there was always the danger of getting lost or simply riding into enemy territory. Nov 23, 1944: &#34;1420 hrs an excited telephone call from 5 CAB (Canadian Armoured Brigade). A DR from that HQ had been sent to the Westminster Regiment and had started out via Highway 16, the main north-south road in Italy running from Canadian lines into the enemy&#39;s. The DR was last seen riding unconcernedly up the road. Nothing further was heard from him. It was found later he was carrying invitations to the dance held by 5 CAB in Cervia.&#34; --- Tom Jeffery On 24 October [1943] the Algonquins were issued the first rum ration in Canadian military history. Nine months later, the Regiment was in France, fighting the enemy instead of hangovers. Outside Caen, near Hubert Folie, roads and fields had been churned up by an armoured blender of tanks, heavy trucks, mines, and artillery fire. Eight inches of dehydrated soil lay loose on the earth, choking the hot August air. Canadian guns continually pounded at the enemy, firing low into the haze. Jeffery and his Norton raced through the smoke and the noise, passing under the barrels of the big guns. &#34;There was a huge explosion and the next thing I was blown off the bike!&#34; --- Art Gaiger Eventually reunited with his outfit, Gaiger&#39;s next harrowing adventure took place outside a brothel in the village of Hardinghen. Actually, technically speaking, it began inside, and following &#34;some wonderful moments that took me from virginity and transformed me into a normal 19-year-old private who never abandoned thereafter the quest for wine, women, and song,&#34; he struck up a conversation with a private who had also just paid his respects to this establishment. The two of them waited upon less hurried friends, and &#34;after some time, the private said he would keep an eye on my Norton if I wanted to hustle up my friend, and I accepted his offer.&#34; Gaiger never saw the Norton again. This put quite a cramp in his DR career, not to mention his new-found hobby. --- Jack Aisbitt &#34;In England, the independence as a DR was great, being able to take off and visit where you wanted with no one the wiser. In Europe, it was dangerous, less places to go, less time, but still I was independent and able to slip away at times. But it was a lonely job after June 6, 1944.&#34; --- &#34;Army vehicles in convoy have an accordion effect as they try to keep evenly spaced. Parts of the convoy are going like hell, while those in front may be slowing rapidly due to some hold-up. This results in a particular hazard for a rider as he tries to duck back in between vehicles while passing to avoid oncoming traffic. A rider had to become proficient at laying the bike down and sliding under the truck, otherwise you were face first into the tailgate. A very good pal, Morley Hicks, an orphan, was killed in a head-on while passing in 1943 while we were in England.&#34; --- A lone provost stood at an intersection that had become known as &#34;Hell&#39;s Corners,&#34; directing a rush of tanks and truck traffic while intermittent shellfire exploded around him. Aisbitt rode up through the mayhem and asked which way to &#34;Thaon&#34;. In the noise and confusion, the decidedly rattled provost pointed left toward Caen and the enemy. Behind the immediate front line of battle there is often as much as a mile of unearthly quiet, where the signs of very recent fighting fester in eerie silence, smothering the world in a battle&#39;s aftermath. Aisbitt was not &#34;fully tuned in to this yet.&#34; He rode swiftly, bouncing along a road without traffic, past the still burning remains of bombed-out Bren carriers, past the shattered and smoking stubs of telephone poles, and past the bodies of fallen men. A soldier knelt in silence beside a new grave. The DR rode on, uneasy and unsure, still carrying his message to battery HQ. The farther he advanced, the more vivid became the signs of human conflict, the blood of its victims still red on grimy uniforms. &#34;I believe it was the Queen&#39;s Own Rifles in action. Had it not been for the motor noise of the Norton, I probably would have heard rifle and machine-gun fire.&#34; Instead, he heard nothing. He followed the road, steering his Norton around the debris, and then around a bend, and... stomp on and grab that Norton&#39;s brakes! A downed motorcycle blocked his path. Beside it, a fellow DR, sprawled out and lifeless. He caught sight of two infantry men behind a roadside sign waving frantically with their arms, motioning him back and away. &#34;I skidded the bike around and went like hell back the way I came. To this day, I can imagine the bullets whistling by me, although I do not know if I was being shot at or not.&#34; --- Leno Caron, Conrade Nelson, and Morley Young &#34;On SDR, you were on standby to take out only top priority messages. We were stationed in Dover and Dick had to make a run to Portsmouth. On his way back, just a few miles from camp, he drifted over to the right-hand side of the road into the path of a three ton lorry. The truck driver tried to avoid him by turning into the embankment on the roadside, but the nose dug in and the truck spun around, killing him.&#34; --- &#34;Whenever we moved camp, two of my fellow DRs, Corporal Lush and Signalman Horton, would always dig a fox hole about five or six feet deep. I would watch, and then dig my hole about a foot deep right near them. When the shelling started and things got too hot, I would jump into their hole. They would curse me and tell me to dig my own hole and I&#39;d say &#39;Yes, yes, but wait till things cool down.&#39; Of course, when the shelling stopped, I didn&#39;t need a deep hole. This went on all across France.&#34; --- &#34;We did get strafed once in a while, even up in the Reichswald, by Messerschmidts, but the pilots were very young, even compared to us. They made serious mistakes. They would fly lengthways down a convoy from the rear at only about tree top level. Being this low, the bullets from the wing guns would straddle the road, missing the vehicles altogether. Fifty feet higher up, and the cones of fire from their guns would have met right on the trucks.&#34; --- &#34;While we were in Belgium stationed near the city of Ghent, we made runs toward Zeebruge on the coast, and to units in the area of the Leopold Canal. The trouble with this was our troops held one side of the canal, and the enemy the other. The shortest route was along the canal, so that&#39;s the way we went. &#34;I would lay down on the tank of my Norton and as far over the side as I could, holding the throttle wide open. That would be about 70 mph on a good day. The enemy would fire at us from across the canal as we rode by like ducks in a shooting gallery.&#34; --- Jim Conway &#34;One of the worst assignments we had was in 1942. We were awakened by a lot of aircraft of all sorts and couldn&#39;t figure out what was happening. Then I got a call from HQ to take half my section and report to the Harbour Master at Portsmouth. We all thought that we were going across the channel. We arrived in the middle of the worst bombing raid I have experienced.&#34; It was the aftermath of Dieppe. The decks of incoming ships were crowded with Canadian soldiers, many of them wounded. Conway and his crew worked all night and well into the next day delivering lists of the names and condition of the survivors to CMHQ in London. The reality of war had docked at Portsmouth. --- George Cuthill&#39;s landing at Normandy &#34;After breakfast, we went up on deck and in due course, my Norton was lowered into the landing barge. I went over the side and down the scramble net to join it. It started easily and I sat there warming it up to be sure everything was okay. One of the sailors asked if I was scared, a foolish question, for anyone who said &#39;no&#39; was lying. He tried to be helpful by telling me that when we landed, we would be in about ten feet of water, but not to worry, they would do their best to get me out. &#39;We don&#39;t lose many,&#39; he said.&#34; As Cuthill couldn&#39;t swim and was burdened down with a full pack, ammunition, and Sten gun, the sailor&#39;s words proved to be of little comfort. The barge started in for shore. &#34;As soon as the ramp went down, I gunned the Norton, let out the clutch, and left the barge like a bullet, hoping to get as far as possible.&#34; What Cuthill couldn&#39;t see from his position down in the barge was that the tide was going out, leaving the front of the ramp high and dry on the beach. &#34;I was half a mile into France before I could stop! When I circled back, my Navy friend was holding his sides in laughter.&#34; --- Red Bullman &#34;Christ, in North Africa, I rode a bike practically all the time.

Darwinism is considered to be hard fact, the only acceptable explanation for the formation of life on Earth, but with keen insight and objectivity Richard Milton reveals that the theory totters atop a shambles of outdated and circumstantial evidence which in any less controversial field would have been questioned long ago. Sticking to the facts at hand and tackling a vast array of topics, <i>Shattering the Myths of Darwinism</i> offers compelling evidence that the theory of evolution has become an act of faith rather than a functioning science, and that not until the scientific method is applied to it and the right questions are asked will we ever get the true answers to the mystery of life on Earth.</p><p>Richard Milton is a journalist working in Britain who has written widely on science and technology. He is also the author of <i>Shattering the Myths of Darwinism</i>.With selective evidence and twisted logic, Milton (Alternative Science, Inner Traditions, 1996) attempts to discredit the concept of organic evolution. Although raising important questions about interpretation and methodology, he fails to overturn the neo-Darwinian framework as he attacks as "myths" the claims of modern science concerning the age of this planet, the geological column with its fossil record, and even the biological relationship between the great apes and our own species. He ignores most of the recent evolutionary literature (especially in paleoanthropology and primatology), and his chapters are full of dated illustrations, misleading generalizations, and glaring errors, e.g., "the evidence for humankind's own evolution is actually nonexistent" and "Today, 'Java man' is thought to be an extinct, giant gibbonlike creature and not connected to humans." His own interpretation of earth history remains ambiguous, leaving the reader to wonder about what hidden motive underscores this morass of falsehoods. Not recommended.?H.

This easy-to-read story about a peddler and a band of mischievous monkeys is filled with warmth, humor, and simplicity. Children will delight in following the peddlers efforts to outwit the monkeys in this new, enlarged, and redesigned edition, and will ask to read it again and again.</p><p>Subtitled <i>A Tale of a Peddler, Some Monkeys and Their Monkey Business</i>, this absurd and very simple story has become a classic, selling hundreds of thousands of copies since its first publication in 1940. A peddler walks around selling caps from a tall, tottering pile on his head. Unable to sell a single cap one morning, he walks out into the countryside, sits down under a tree, checks that all the caps are in place, and falls asleep. When he wakes up, the caps are gone--and the tree is full of cap-wearing monkeys. His attempts to get the caps back generate the kind of repetitive rhythm that 3- and 4-year-olds will adore. (Preschool and older) <i>--Richard Farr</i><em>Monkey Business</em>"Caps! Caps for sale! Fifty cents a cap!" The peddler has huge stack of caps, balanced carefully on top of his head. Brown caps, blue caps, gray caps, and red caps. But no one wants to buy a cap. So he goes for a walk in the country, and takes a nap under a shady tree. When he wakes up, the caps are gone -- al except his own checked one. Where could his caps have disappeared to? And how will he ever get them back?</p><h2>Bearymore</h2><p>A circus bear has trouble hibernating and dreaming up a new act at the same time.</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low.</p><h2>I Want to Paint My Bathroom Blue</h2><p>Continuing a two-year program to bring back twenty-two Maurice Sendak treasures long out of print, our second season of publication highlights one of the most successful author-illustrator pairings of all time. A pioneer of great children&#39;s literature, Ruth Krausspublished more than thirty books for children during a career that spanned forty years. Krauss and Sendak collaborated on eight books, and we are delighted to reintroduce four of these gems in brand-new editions, together with a favorite Maurice Sendak picture book.</p><p><p>Ruth Krauss (1901-1993) is the author of over thirty books for children, including the classics <em>The Carrot Seed</em>, illustrated by her husband, Crockett Johnson, and <em>A Hole Is to Dig</em>, illustrated by Maurice Sendak. "Ruth Krauss's intuitive ability as a writer to capture the free-spirited thought processes and laughter of young children ensures her books' widespread acceptance and timeless appeal." So concludes her entry in children's <em>Books and Their Creators</em> (1995).</p><br><br><p>In addition to <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>, Maurice Sendak's books include <em>Kenny's Window</em>, <em>Very Far Away</em>, <em>The Sign on Rosie's Door</em>, <em>Nutshell Library</em> (consisting of <em>Chicken Soup with Rice</em>, <em>Alligators All Around</em>, <em>One Was Johnny</em>, and <em>Pierre</em>), <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life</em>, <em>In the Night Kitchen</em>, <em>Outside Over There</em>, <em>We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy</em>, and <em>Bumble-Ardy</em>.</p><p>He received the 1964 Caldecott Medal for <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>; the 1970 Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration; the 1983 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, given by the American Library Association in recognition of his entire body of work; and a 1996 National Medal of Arts in recognition of his contribution to the arts in America. In 2003, he received the first Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, an international prize for children's literature established by the Swedish government.</p>Now in its second season, HarperCollins's reissue of 22 Sendak classics continues. This time, his collaborations with Ruth Krauss take center stage. In Charlotte and the White Horse, first published in 1955, creamy pages frame Sendak's softly lit illustrations of a girl who convinces her father to keep a wobbly legged horse and cares for him until he can stand on his own. Sendak's delicate watercolors suit the dream-like mood of a boy who accomplishes all that he sets out to do in his imaginary world, in I Want to Paint My Bathroom Blue (1956), also by Krauss. A boy's imagination also comes to the fore in A Very Special House (1953) by Krauss, as the artist depicts the hero creating a home filled with a turtle, a giant, a very old lion and "some monkeys and some skunkeys." Oversize pages brim with the creatures as well as his house's "very special" furnishings. Open House for Butterflies (1960) takes a similar format to these collaborators' classic A Hole Is to Dig, and lastly, Hector Protector and As I Went Over the Water: Two Nursery Rhymes (1965) by Sendak conveys as much plot through the artist's wordless spreads as with the minimal text.

A fine synthesis of a very difficult corpus of information that establishes a baseline for further scholarship on issues of serious historical and archaeological importance.

Wilson is the former James Collins Professor of Management at UCLA and Shattuck Professor of Government at Harvard. He is the author of several books, including <em>The Moral Sense,</em> and has served on a number of national commissions concerned with public policy. He currently lectures at Pepperdine University.</p>*Starred Review* Justly renowned for his gift for converting opaque sociology into lucid arguments, Wilson here ponders the cultural dynamics of America's remarkable retreat from wedlock. Though some have blamed the nation's epidemics of divorce and illegitimacy on the tumultuous1960s, Wilson probes much deeper. His careful scholarship uncovers the subtle ways in which ancient African kinship patterns still affect social life in the inner city and illuminates the legal traditions that turned eighteenth-century philosophizing into twentieth-century divorce statutes. But Wilson aims to explain not only how marriage has lost strength in modern America but also why that loss matters. With a raft of recent studies, he shows that once a society loses the anchorage of wedlock, riptides begin to pull entire communities into alienation and despair. Wilson particularly laments the suffering of children exposed to poverty and emotional confusion by the disintegration of their families. And it is precisely because the toll of family dissolution has run so high that Wilson challenges his readers to join in the search for ways to renew wedlock. That renewal, he makes clear, will require more than legislative finesse by shrewd lawmakers; it will require a profound shift in the entire culture. Wilson's sobering analysis will help spark the kind of public discussions that often presage such a shift. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But the Owens siblings are desperate to uncover who they really are. Each heads down a life-altering course, filled with secrets and truths, devastation and joy, and magic and love.

This time, instead of showcasing the worst examples of a period dish, they try to select the best, so if you can forget about cholesterol, you might find yourself nostalgia-tripping with such innocent showoff foods as fondue, cr&#x2c6;pes suzette, and baked Alaska. Unlike the exclusionary epicures before them or the status-grabbing foodies of the Eighties, the Sterns maintain, the gourmets featured here were motivated by a sense of adventure about exploring foreign foods and a genuine desire to experience and provide pleasurable dining. The Sterns' commentary on all this is on the mark (though they misrepresent Taste of America authors John and Karen Hess, who came later and were antigourmet), entertaining (uncovering many cookbooks, cooking shows, and new flamboyant restaurants from Trader Vic's--the ersatz Polynesian establishment created out of a French Canadian's Oakland place called Hinky Dink's--to the more serious Four Seasons), and fondly evocative of those heady days of sauced and flaming spectacles.

All rights reserved.</i>Respected arbiters of camp and kitsch, the prolific Sterns ( The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste ) currently focus their talent for connecting culture and food on an aspect of an era that, until now, has received little notice. While the lowbrow culinary cliches of the '50s and '60s were real enough, there also existed alongside them a very upper-middle-class appreciation of what the Sterns call "The Good Life," in which " coq au vinsic replaced dowdy casseroles on the women's pages of upwardly striving daily newspapers" and according to which "travelers could enjoy such delicacies as coquilles St. Jacques and creme brulee in the dining room of nearly any Holiday Inn." While many such recipes are easily found in volumes that serious cooks may have relegated to the dusty back shelves of their collections, a number of those included here are welcome revivals ("incredibly rich lobster Thermidor"). Others, like "1964 World's Fair Sangria," are amusing relics. And some--"Life-Affirming Moussaka" and "Aphrodisiacal Artichokes"--divulge a rarely seen '50s sensibility. In their inimitably witty, urbane and wonderfully entertaining style, the Sterns give the era its due. Photos not seen by PW.

Their wait lasted two years. Maynard's beautifully written, courageous memoir tells the fascinating story of how they survived. The refugees encountered typhoons, fires and cobras; they lived on dwindling stores of canned food. Mary begins to perceive the social politics and prejudices that exist on the island, and she survives a sexual assault. Like <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i> or <i>Empire of the Sun, My Faraway Home</i> gives a fresh perspective on war through a child's eyes.<br>Mary McKay Maynard is a painter and freelance writer. In recent years she has attended meetings of other WWII Philippines survivors, such as the American guerillas her family knew and the submariners who rescued her, and shared her story with them. She and her husband have three adult children and live in Connecticut.</p>
